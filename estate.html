<h2>Estate Details</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Federal Estate Tax</b> - Must file IRS Form 706 (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i706/ch01.html">instructions</a>) if estate exceeds $5.4M (2015). Otherwise no requirement to file, unless you wish to transfer Exemption surplus to the surviving spouse (which is useful if surviving spouse will have >$5.4M).  Executor files 706 and must have proof of status: notarized will or court order.</li>

  <li><b>Michigan Estate Tax</b> - Inactive starting 2005 and still true in 2016 (<a href="http://www.michigan.gov/taxes/0,1607,7-238-44143-156393--,00.html">MI Estate Tax Forms page</a>). MI tax is linked to federal state death tax credit, so it may reappear if federal law changes. </li>

  <li><b>Michigan Probate</b> - <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/michigan-probate-an-overview.html">Nolo Press</a> says probate is only required if deceased person owns assets in his name alone. </li>

  <li><b>Power of Appointment</b> - <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2041">US Code definition</a>
  </li>

  <li><b>Annuities</b> - All withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Annuities are one of the few assets that does NOT qualify for step-up basis upon inheritance.</li>

  <li><b>Unrecorded Real Estate Transfers</b> - (Quit Claim Deeds, etc) - When trying to record them years later, it will probably work if there are no competing claims, but:
    <ul>
       <li>The recipient's cost basis will be as of the signed date</li>
       <li>It may cause a retroactive increase in State Equalized Value (MI) or equivalent, which will incur back taxes and penalties</li>
       <li>It may retroactively disqualify property tax Homestead Exemption (MI), incurring back taxes and penalties</li>
       <li>It may retroactively disqualify state income tax Homestead credit (MI), incurring back taxes and penalties</li>

<h2>Trust Downsides</h2>

	  We hired an attny to try and compel annual reports, paid out thousands and never got them. We were told that an aggressive trust attny can stonewall and make it very expensive to go to compel (legally required) disclosure by resisting, short of a court order.

my observation with family member trustees is that they do what they want unless someone catches them quickly and brings in lawyers.

	<blockquote>
This seems to basically be a case of a successor trustee substituting his wishes for those of the grantor (grandma). There was another thread in the last week (entitled "ethics concern with trust") where the trustee ran roughshod over the interests of the remaindermen beneficiaries. [...] Individual successor trustees seem to act in ways the grantor did not envision with some frequency.

   <blockquote>
     In 1954 my dear grandmother made a testamentary trust naming Southeast Bank as trustee. Southeast Bank was the largest State bank, with the largest trust department, and was located at the top of the tallest building in Miami. Grandmother died in 1962. My brother and I were beneficiaries of the trusts stocks & bonds, with my mother to receive all their income. Our mother died in 1989 and my brother and I received the trust investments.

I was just beginning to learn about personal investing and was shocked to find how badly the fund had been managed by the bank's very elaborate and expensive trust department. We filed suit against the bank (the only lawsuit I ever filed). This is part of the lawsuit:

During the period of time that the trust funds were being managed and invested by Southeast Bank, the corpus of the trusts experienced an increase in value of approximately one half percent per year. -- During the seventeen year period preceding the distribution of the trust assets the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose approximately three hundred percent.

     As someone currently dealing with not only a corporate trustee but also a completely unnecessary trust protector, I urge you to be firm on this. It’s literally millions of dollars. And beyond the money, they can create “issues” out of thin air to justify legal fees in addition to the sickening AUM fees.

     The trusts are held with a large US banking institution. [...] Getting information about the total fees charged has been like pulling teeth. 'Oh, it is complicated, it varies based upon the funds chosen, it is a bit different for each of the trusts.' My best estimate is that the total all-in fees are in the range of 2.5% of assets under management.

   <blockquote>
Beneficiaries can fire the trustee but the trust protector has to approve a new one, and has made clear the current corporate trustee is going to continue in that role. The trust protector drafted the documents and has a (surprise) very sweet deal where he has to approve any distributions and gets to bill a functionally unlimited amount to “review” requests.

      Yes had to go through the whole nine yards trial and everything for estate. [...] On the trust, I got three years distributions (out of 30) the rest the Trustee squandered on legal defending her breach(es) at trust's expense. Which is improper, but I have learned, in the law, it all just opinions; nothing is illegal or wrong until a Judge says so.

<h2>Planning Ahead</h2>

<h3>Easy, short term items:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Will</b> - write or review your will. Nolo Press is a good resource.
      Most important points to cover are child custody, child trusts, and unusual assets.
      Ordinary bank and investments typically follow the beneficiary designation. </li>
  <li><b>Health Power of Attorney</b> - write or review your health POA. Many states
      have free online statuatory forms.  Most important points are to review the designee and alternates,
      and to have as few triggering conditions as you are comfortable with. </li>
  <li><b>Financial Power of Attorney</b> - write or review your financial POA.
      Many states have free online statuatory forms.  Most important points are to review the assignee
      and alternates, to have as few triggering conditions as you can tolerate, and to
      ensure it says a copy is as valid as the original (many entities will otherwise require
      the original)</li>
  <li><b>Beneficiaries</b> - list all financial accounts and check/set the beneficiary for each</li>
  <li><b>Notification</b> - notify a family member of the location of your documents.
      If they are difficult to access (in an controlled-access apartment, safety deposit box,
      etc), make arrangements for access. Note that Safety Deposit Boxes are sealed upon death.</li>
  <li><b>Wishes Document</b> - write or review your "wishes" document, which contains non
      binding useful information for hiers, including a list of your assets, funeral
      preferences, etc.  [add link to my sample]</li>
</ul>

<h3>More difficult, longer term items</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Consider State of Residence</b> - some states have high estate taxes even for modestly sized estates.
    See <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.ord">Tax Foundation</a> maps.
    <img width="640" src="http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/Estate%20Taxes-01_0.png"/>
  </li>
  <li><b>Living Trusts or LLCs</b> - put non-beneficiary property into a Living Trust or LLC
      to avoid probate. Do this for all real estate plus any unusual assets</li>
  <li><b>Simplify Accounts</b> - review accounts and consolidate or close unnecessary ones.
      Each separate entity causes significant extra paperwork</li>
  <li><b>Large Estate Tax Planning</b> - for estates that may reach federal tax levels, consider
      planning measures:
      <ul>
	<li>Annual gifts - maximize annual gift tax exclusion. Use high cost basis items,
            leaving low cost basis items in estate for basis step-up</li>
        <li>Use the exclusion early - it locks in today's exclusion as a min, and allows
            money to grow during your life outside your estate</li>
	<li>Use GRATs - transer money via GRATs, which uses no exclusion
	   <a href="http://www.aaepa.com/2010/05/shortterm-zeroedout-grats/">(article on zeroed GRATs)</a></li>
        <li>Donate - donate appreciated securities to charity (todo: find out if donations can trigger upon death)</li>
	<li>Divest of difficult assets - those that are complicated to value or subdivide</li>
      </ul>
   </li>

</ul>
