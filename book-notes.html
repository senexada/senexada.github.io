  <li>34 - Taught himself trig to understand an astrology book. Began Euclid but discarded as a waste of time.</li>
  <li>36 - Masted Descartes' Geometry by restarting book whenever stuck. Sometimes progress was 2 pages per restart.</li>
  <li>41 - Plague in 1665. Moved back to Wollsthorpe for two years. Great fire 1666.</li>

  <li>96 - Confessed reading Christian Champions as a violation of the Sabbath</li>
  <li>108 - Verified Kepler's ellipses would arise from 1/r2 force in 1679, but kept it secret</li>
  <li>108 - Philosophical point: simple mathematics was seen as proof of correctness</li>
  <li>109 - Gravity was contra Descartes's matter system, in which force reuired contact (ether).
            Jesuits decreed no action at a distance.</li>
  <li>116 - In 1684 Royal Society's big topic is path under 1/r2. Halley travels to Cambridge

            Newton couldn't find the papers and rederiving it rekindled his interest in math.</li>
  <li>120 - Halley published at own expense the Principia. Third volume done in July 1687, age 44.
            Undermined Descartes with invisible action at a distance.
            Used proposition system like Euclid. Axioms were inertia, F=ma, equal & opposite force.

<h3>How Will You Measure Your Life by Clayton Christensen</h3>
Finished Dec 2016.
It is a business-school-type book with principles and research for contemplating
and planning your career and family life.  The chapters stand by themselves and are
only loosley coupled.
<ul>
  <li>Chap 1 -- History & "advice" is too anecdotal; experience is too slow (do you want N marriages
      before you get good?); theory is required.  This book gives a framework, not answers. 
      The framework is built on fundamental research.  Ancillary point: convince smart people through
      allegories that they apply to themselves (Grove Intel example). </li>
  <li>Section 1 Intro -- Goal is to form a strategy to wake up every morning feeling lucky to be doing
      what you are.</li>
  <li>Chap 2 -- Incentives are popular but are only narrowly useful.  Herzberg's motivation theory
      proposes hygiene & motivation factors.  Once hygiene are good enough, you should ignore them.
      Motivation factors are the primary drivers of your personal energy & satisfaction.  Hygiene are
      comp, status, work conditions & policies; motivation are challenging work, recognition,
      responsibility, and personal growth.</li>
  <li>Chap 3 -- Initial strategy should be malleable to accomodate emergent opportunities
      (eg Honda dirtbikes).  Analyze new initiatives with a ranked list of assumptions that must
      be true for the strategy to work.</li>
  <li>Chap 4 -- Your actual strategy is where you spend your time, money, and energy.  Most people
      choose immediate gratification over long term strategy.  Analyzing your time/money/energy
      helps clarify things.</li>
  <li>Chap 5 -- Plant saplings before you need shade.  In business, seek profit first and growth
      later (eg Honda dirtbikes vs Iridium).  In personal life, family and friends will tolerate
      neglect, but time and words are long term investments that shouldn't be procrastinated.</li>
  <li>Chap 6 -- What job does it sole?  Eg Ikea, milkshakes.  Personal: apply to relationships:
      what job does my spouse need me to do?  It's a type of practical approach to empathy.</li>
  <li>Chap 7 -- In outsourcing, each step is rational, but end result is failure (eg Dell & Asus).
      Capabilities = resources (what) + processes (how) + priorities (why).  Household chores
      develop these skills in kids; outsourcing them is like Dell.  Don't outsource your role as
      parent.  (This chapter was a little long and convoluted)</li>
  <li>Chap 8 -- Choose experiences for your children that prepare them for life.  I didn't find
      anything compelling worth noting.</li>
  <li>Chap 9 -- Culture is created by doing things together, over and over.  Eg Clay only did
      housework when a kid was helping.  Important to work together and celebrate successes
      together.</li>
  <li>Chap 10 -- Marginal cost analysis is dangerous.  Eg Blockbuster, US Steel.  
      A bit of an encore on the intrasitive property of decisions: each increment may be
      prudent, but the end result is worse.  Applies marginal cost to moral realm: don't 
      take the first wrong step.  It is hard to measure the marginal cost of not doing good
      things.</li>
  <li>Epilogue -- Business needs a purpose. Your life does too.  Purpose has a
    <ul>
      <li>likeness - a sketch of what the end of the path looks like</li>
      <li>commitment - maybe even a conversion, to adapt and perservere</li>
      <li>metrics - a few measures (or just one) to keep focus</li>
    </ul>
    The how (how you get there) is typically emergent.
    The world does not deliver purposes; you must conceive, choose, manage. 
    Purpose itself can develop with time.  Clay's likeness was dedicated to improving
    lives, be kind, honest, forgiving, selfless husband/father/friend, and man who
    believes God.  His commitment was structured daily time to pray.  His metric took
    15 years to develop, and is one-on-one impacts on people's lives.  The more he focused
    on his own problems, the more despair he felt.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Chartism - Thomas Carlyle</h3>
<p>Chartism is the name for a working class (the poor) political movement in
mid 1800s in Britain.  It is named after their 6-point Charter, which focused on
political representation for the poor through universal male suffrage and fewer
requirements for parliamentarians. </p>

<p><b>Chapter 1 - Chartism</b>
Carlyle states that condition of the working class is an enormous political question.
Their "chartism" is a symptom of an underlying problem, but what causes it, and what
will satisfy it?  The disease may be real or may be imagined; either way, Coercion will fail as a remedy.  
The condition of the body of people is equivalent to the condition of the nation;
popular political issues are a distraction.  Parliament itself is a distraction and works
for its own sake.  Our main question is why the working classes are discontented.
If we can identify the reason, and the right way to fix it, then men will fight for right;
no one chooses to fight for the wrong.  All battle is the exercise of ascertaining might or right.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2 - Statistics</b>
His introductory paragraph is incredible; it should be the foreword of every statistics textbook
and class forevermore.  It describes the dangers of statistics and the necessity of wisdom.
There are innumerable circumstances, and omitting just one may omit the single vital lynchpin.
He questions whether the statistics of his day are representative or were sampled too narrowly.
He describes how wages is a meager measure of success; can a man improve himself by thrift and
industry, can a willing man find work, what are his relationships?  
Banks open and have deposits but a local knows that his
fellows are saving less than before: the modern practices are deceptive.</p>

<h3>Charlie Munger, Daily Journal 2017 Meeting</h3>

It’s a long slow kind of business.[…] I love that kind of stuff, when I think we’re taking territory.  It doesn’t look good when we write it off and we don’t report wonderful numbers or anything. But if it makes sense in the long term, we just don’t give a damn what it looks like over the short term. And we know it’s good for a bunch of shareholders that share our ideas.  After all we’re running a cult, not a normal company.  And I think mostly the feel is that you’re willing to wait.<br/>

I’ve lived all my life with people who were into deferred gratification. In fact, most of them will never have any fun.  They’ll just defer gratification all the way to the end, that’s what we do.  And it does cause you to get rich.  So we’re going to have a lot of rich dead people.

Well, I coined that term, the lollapalooza effect, because when I realized that I didn’t know any psychology and that was a mistake on my part, I bought the 3 main textbooks for introductory psychology and I read through them. And of course, being Charlie Munger, I decided that the psychologists were doing it all wrong and I could do it better.  </br>

And one of the ideas that I came up with which wasn’t in any of the books was that the lollapalooza effects came when 3 or 4 of these tendencies were operating at once in the same situation.  I could see that it wasn’t linear, you got lollapalooza effects, but the psychology people couldn’t do experiments where 4 or 5 things were happening at once because it got too complicated for them, and they couldn’t publish. So they were ignoring the most important thing in their own profession.  <br/>

And of course the other thing that was important was to synthesize psychology with all else.  The trouble with the psychology profession is that they don’t know anything about all else.  You can’t synthesize something you know with something you don’t know if you don’t know the other thing.

That’s a good lesson, that’s a good question. What happened is the value of my partnership, that I was running, went down by 50% in one year. Now the market went down 40% or something. It was a once in 30 year recession;  monopoly newspapers were selling at 3-4x earnings.  And at the bottom tick I was down from the peak 50%, or right about that.  And that has happened to me 3 times with my Berkshire stock.  So I regard it as a part of manhood: that if you’re going to be in this game for the long haul, which is the way to do it, you better be able to handle a 50% decline without fussing too much about it.  So my lesson to all of you is to conduct your life so that you can handle a 50% decline with aplomb and grace.   Don’t try to avoid it.  It will come. In fact, if it doesn’t come, I would say you aren’t being aggressive enough.

<h3>AntiFragile - Nassim Taleb</h3>
<i>(read in Jan 2017)</i>
<ul>
 <li>Less is more</li>
 <li>Volatily == stressor == time == uncertainy == entropy</li>
 <li>Action is superior to language, theory, or study.  Ex: Greeks excelled in the sea but had no word for blue</li>
 <li>Worst-case historic anlysis is inately foolish: when the worst case occurred, it was worse than anything ever seen before</li>
 <li>Nonlinear systems have unclear causality.  "Causal opacity."  Do weak bones cause senility or vice versa or circular?</li>
 <li>Ancestral life lacking chronic stress. Acute stress is good but requires a recovery period.</li>
 <li>City states are antifragile</li>
 <li>Noise helps systems: simulated annealing, donkey between hay piles</li>
 <li>Iatrogenics is harm caused by healer. Tonsillitis, Semelweis, etc.</li>
 <li>Procrastination is a natural sign of unimportance</li>
 <li>Harvard social science library has 9000 years of reading and most of it is useless</li>
 <li>Stalin could not exist in a municipality. Small things are more antifragile.</li>
 <li>1/N investing: invest in every Nth company. Has high optionality.</li>
 <li>Rank options in terms of optionality; choose the one with unbounded payoffs and bounded risks</li>
 <li>Invest in people, not plans</li>
 <li>(Munger also talks about big biased bets; he favors a few big vs Taleb many small)</li>
 <li>History is written by theorists because the doers are too busy doing.  They pretend
     that theory led to application. Mostly the opposite is true. Tinkering creates something,
     theory arrives at maturity to explain it.</li>
 <li>Antifragile items exhibit power law survivorship: remaining life expectancy is proportional to age.
     The longer a book has been in print the longer it will be on expectation.</li>
 <li>Timely material (newspapers, etc) are instantly obsolete</li>
</ul>
<p>Volatility happens.  Same things get worse (fragile). Some things don't change (robust). Some things
   get better (antifragile).  Think in terms of optionality: how to capture unbounded upside surprises
   with bounded negative surprises.  Expert knowledge is often wrong due to unmeasured negatives.
   They are by nature impossible to predict.  History books are wrong because they are written by theorists.
   Common sense heuristics are best; they exist for a reason; the longer something existed the longer
   it will continue.  Structure your life to be antifragile where you can.</p>
