  <span class="dropcap">T</span>wice in this series we have exited the
  backcountry early: once for wildfire smoke, once for a confluence
  of heavy winds and route challenge.  This year was our third early exit,
  for a new reason to be revealed to the perservering reader. As usual,
  you may click images for a high-res version.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day One</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Bozeman was our launch point into the 944,000-acre Absaroka Beartooth
  Wilderness, which lies along the north border of Yellowstone. 
  We departed the downtown Kimpton (brand new) on Saturday morning Aug 6
  after a superb avocado toast on site.  Driving by 7:40am, we took I-90
  east to Livingston, exited onto Swingley Rd, and lost cell service by
  08:25.  We hit the National Forest boundary at 09:00, heading into the
  valley amid an unsettled forecast and clouds that threatened rain.
</p>

<p class="caption">Southbound on Boulder Creek Rd, with rain threatening</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
  Road quality was excellent, and the road had been repaired from a major recent washout,
  presumably due to the many large permanent camps along this stretch.
  It degraded only for the last handful of miles, during which we 
  averaged 8-10 mph, reaching Upsidedown Trailhead (our exit point) at 09:58 and
  Box Canyon Trailhead (our starting point) at 10:10.  A few spots felt
  sketchy in our SUVs, so we were humbled to see six horse trailers and a Corolla
  were among the ten vehicles at the trailhead. 
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    It was about 50F and verging on rain as we packed.
    We got the group shot at a fine bridge right at the parking lot.
</p>


<div class="photo"><a href="">

  <p class="regtext">
    The trail up East Fork Boulder Creek began wide and gentle, quickly entering the tall pines.
</p>

<p class="caption">An easy stroll into the clouds on East Fork Boulder Creek</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    The rain started about noon and continued most of the day and night, so the photo
    above is all you get today.  The handful of unforested sections had nothing to see due to
    the rain and mist. But the trail was gentle, the creeks were
    well-bridged, and the forest was glistening, so it was a pleasant hike nonetheless.
</p>

<p class="caption">Ok, I lied, I found one more unspectactular photo before the rain</p></div>
  
<p class="regtext">
  We couldn't see much in the mist, but we passed a few erratic boulder fields interrupting the forest,
  and saw the small lake after the Rainbow Creek junction, which was pretty and had a campsite.
</p>

<p class="regtext">  
    We continued up Rainbow Creek to a decent campsite (or so it seemed in the mist) at about 8800'.
    We managed with great effort to burn the drenched wood in a meager fire, just enough to
    cook the steaks.  Despite several heavy bouts of rain, which soaked every sock I
    was carrying,
    everyone was satisfied with the day: good trail, good distance, good elevation,
    reasonable temperatures, and no mosquitos.  There wasn't much lounging after dinner, as the rain continued
    most of the night.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  At 8:30 the glorious sun reached our camp.  I spent a couple hours drying my entire wardrobe,
  and others did similarly. We broke camp at 11am and by noon I felt hot and dry, a short six
  hours after feeling that everything I owned would be damp the entire trip.  We declared
  a "0%" chance of rain for the rest of the trip.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    We passed a handful of groups today after seeing only two people in yesterday's rain.
    Ascending toward Lake Plateau, we encountered the first meaningful meadows and open vistas.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ttKDnjR/0/4K/i-ttKDnjR-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">Up Trail 28, approaching Lake Plateau</p></div>
  
  <p class="regtext">
    At Wounded Man Lake we passed two fisherman. Continuing along its north shore on
    trail 93, there was deadfall across the trail and accordingly no sign of recent
    stock usage.  We took a break at the foot of Lake Pinchot before moving onward toward
    our target of Ravin (or maybe Cimmerian) Lake.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-b2NZWth/0/4K/i-b2NZWth-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">North shore of Woulded Man or Pinchot (not sure which) from Trail 91</p></div>
  
  <p class="regtext">
    The trail after Pinchot became narrow & overgrown as it steeply descended the
    forested ravine. Dreary Lake is aptly named and had no decent campsites, due to sloped forest or
    marshy ground everywhere we scouted.
  </p>

  <p class="regtext">
    After Dreary, we lost the trail as it braided through a few small
    meadows. Ultimately we found it again at a bridge across the stream near Lake Ravin.
    Ravin was beautiful, but
    we scouted all the way to
    Ravin foot without finding a large enough campsite.  We considered scouting onward to Lake
    Surrender, but ultimately surrendered even sooner and worked our way back upstream toward
    Pinchot. There was a decent site north of the trail
    on the west end of Ravin, but the views weren't as good as the foot of Pinchot, so we
    continued to retrace our steps upstream.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    Around 5:30 we reached the beautiful meadow at the foot of Lake Pinchot, having traveled
    9.5 miles today (27k steps according to my watch).
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    We ate Ramen and S'mores and began to battle the mosquitos, which will figure prominently
    over the next two days.  The headnets were well worth their 1oz weight.  Any exposed
    skin, or skin beneath a single layer, was attacked.  As it cooled enough to don multi-layer mosquito
    protection we watched twilight over the lake.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  The stationary day debates began: who would day hike and where? Who would begin
  agitating for Vegas?  What year will standard cell phones have satellite texting?
  How much total solar radiation energy (all frequencies) would be collected right
  here this morning (8am) vs solar noon (~1pm) by by a plane
  normal to the sun's rays.
</p>

    <p class="regtext">
      For the last question, after Jeff made an outrageous claim, the subsequent guesses
      recorded in the backcountry were:
      <table class="narrowtable">
	<tr><td>Suhas</td><td>0.05</td>
	<tr><td>John</td><td>0.1</td>

    <p class="regtext">
      On the topic of day hike, despise the clouds of mosquitos, the only takers for a stroll
      above treeline (mosquito free?) were Bill and me -- oh Jason, where art though?
      We targeted the unnamed
      mountain south of Lake Pinchot and west of Clam Lake. Heading southbound along the west
      shore of Dreary Lake required a significant traverse through a talus field.

    <p class="regtext">
      The traverse was not too bad on the way up, yielding good views of Dreary and
      Ravin Lakes.

	<p class="regtext">
	  I spotted Trouble Lake on our ascent but didn't capture a good photo.  There
	  were some interesting rock slabs near its outlet.  I never caught a good look
	  at Clam Lake, due to the topography and forest.
	</p>

	<p class="regtext">	
	  We reached the unmarked summit after about two hours of hiking. 
	  Despite the rocky terrain and high winds, there were... mosquitos.

<p class="caption">Looking west to Lake Plateau from near the summit</p></div>

    <p class="regtext">
      Due to the flat mountain top, we had to move slightly downhill and north to
      see Lake Pinchot. Our campsite is not quite visible, even on the high res
      version, due to iphone lens limitation.  Diaphonous Lake and the tiny unnamed lake
      above Pinchot looked attactive, as did the nice hikeable-looking ramp from there to Chalice Peak.

      <p class="regtext">
	This was a solid day trip: good views, good distance, good challenge.  We basically retraced our
	route on the descent.  At one point of the talus slope we diverged and found ourself
	among car-sized to house-sized boulders, which made for slow and fatiguing down-climbing.

    We found the stationary folks to be stationary and bemoaning the mosquitos.
    It was difficult to swim without numerous bites.
</p>


  <p class="regtext">
    The backcountry pizza collaboration was great, as usual, with half of them
    cooked with our masterly wood-fired grilled pizza technique.  This dinner is a true
    backcountry treat. (But Suhas says: always remind him about the glutard and lactard).

    defeat the mosquitos, we watched the orange twilight over Pinchot.

Mileage and elevations were good. The last two days were most scenic. It was good to do the
Tin Cup Trail downhill rather than uphill.

The unnamed peak (mentioned in the Teton NP episode) looks to be a unique, spectacular spot to
view and photograph Grand Teton.  It may be worth a return trip, hiking out Mink Lake through
the National Park.  The Teton Crest route also looks appealing.  Some related Teton Crest links:
