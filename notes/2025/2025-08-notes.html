<h3>Backpacking calorie usage</h3>

<p>Pandolf equation =</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Watts = 1.5*W + 2*(W+L)*(L/W)^2 + n*(W+L)*(1.5V^2 + 0.35*V*G)</p>

<p>W = body weight (kg) <br />
L = load on back (kg) <br />
n = terrain factor (pavement 1.0; packed dirt 1.2; sand 1.5; snow 2+) <br />
V = walking speed (m/s) <br />
G = grade (%)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For 170 lb person, 25 lb pack, at usual backpacking speed on dirt,
it computes to a baseline 2400 calories, plus 50-80 cal per mile
(50 @ 2 mph, 80 @ 3.1, mostly linear), plus 250 cal per thousand vertical feet.
(Velocity is squared in the equation, but the equation is instantaneous
power (Watts), and faster speed means less time per mile, so energy cancels
out to linear with speed).</p>

contributed to the works of many other researchers and is always referenced
as a trusted place to begin any load carriage study."  It also says that
subsequent criticism of Pandolf's estimates is partly due to load
distribution: Pandolf used weight on back, while modern studies use modern
military distribution of torso armour, weapon in hands, boots on feet, etc.</p></li>

<h3>Calories per volume for backpacking</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 cup = 13 in^3</li>
<li>1 TB = 0.9 in^3</li>
<li>rice or beans = 700 cal/cup = 54 cal/in^3</li>
<li>oats = 300 cal/cup = 23 cal/in^3</li>
<li>olive oil = 120 cal/TB = 132 cal/in^3</li>

  <p>From here, we continued several more miles through the untracked East Canyon
of Torrey Creek. The going was extremely slow, because the terrain consisted
of bogs, dead-fall trees, and talus fans. We camped at 9,600 feet elevation
in a small meadow beneath towering cliffs.</p>

We saw one other couple the first day. A solo trekker the second day.
Three people passing through the third day, and no one else the fourth and fifth days. Sweet!</p>

<h3>Old timey strongman</h3>

<p>The protein question got me wondering how old-timey strongmen ate.
Which led to fabulous primary sources from early 1900s.
Great stuff in thread.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oldtimestrongman.com/images/joe_norquest_1-arm-lift_strongman_globe_barbella.jpg" alt="Joe Nordquest" /></p>

<p>Firstly, the strongmen weren't very quantitative on their "macros."  They basically said to eat meat, milk, and veggies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Milk is a perfect food, and a splendid drink after exercise is an egg beaten up in milk, 
or a glass of hot milk. As a rule, the claims of patent or concentrated foods for the 
would-be strong man should be taken cum grano salis. One preparation, however, which 
I can conscientiously recommend is that known as "Bovril." It is a fact that most 
leading athletes recommend "Bovril," and nothing can be better either before or 
immediately after practice than a cup of hot "Bovril."
It prevents and dispels fatigue. Oatmeal with milk is splendid for building up the 
muscular system, as well as cheese, beans, and peas of all kinds, which contain the 
necessary elements for renewing tissue. I am not a vegetarian, and therefore advise the use of beef, mutton, etc.

</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe in plenty of beef, particularly when in training, supplemented by 
vegetables and whole wheat bread, which is made of whole rye meal. This diet is 
further added to by fruit for its laxative quality. To maintain proper elimination 
we never resort to laxatives other than found in the foods we eat. A light breakfast,
with the two main meals to follow in their turn is our rule, and about two hours 
before retiring we take a light lunch which brings on relaxation so necessary to 
bringing sleep. A person slightly hungry before retiring is not altogether relaxed.</p>

<p>In regard to training I am in favor of a varied program; light and heavy exercises,
 and I also favor a certain amount of running and jumping and other outdoor exercise of a lively nature.</p>

<p>The lifting of heavy weights appealed to me early in my career, as it 
imparted to my body a degree of muscular development I think I could not have attained by any other exercise.

<p>This 1937 article contains perhaps the first usage of the idea "there's no food in your food":</p>

<p>The head of Harvard's gymnasium in 1904 (Dudley Sargeant, what a name), said average man should eat 125g protein, but then said oh maybe half that.</p>

<p>Readers Digest <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/1920s-advice-weight-advice/">Jan 1920 article</a> said about 40-60g protein:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For proteins take one-third of a pound of meat and two eggs daily.
Most of our other foods will contain a small amount of protein,
which will make up the balance of what you need.</p>

<p>But where it really gets fabulous is Physical Culture Magazine.
Circa 1901, and it reads like current year twitter feed + podcast queue.
(the dude who started it changed his name from Bernard to Bernarr because
it sounded like the roar of a lion; he was a vegetarian, hated white bread, and claimed he would live to 150

<p>All the following from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/physical-culture-v-05n-01-1901-04.-physical-culture-d-m/page/n49/mode/2up">April 1901 Issue of Physical Culture</a> :</p>

<p>And that's just one issue. An enterprising young grad student could probably map every topic
in a Huberman season to an article or ad in the 1900-1910 Physical Culture mag.</p>

<p>The only thing strangely absent was the cornerstone of modern podcasting: selling vitamins.  Maybe vitamins didn't exist back then?</p>
