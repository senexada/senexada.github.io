<h3>Global Cooling in 1970s</h3>

<h4>1) NOAA Magazine, Oct 1974, Volume 4 Number 4</h4>

<ul class="regtext">
 <li><b>Text Excerpt</b> - Many climatologists have associated this [prolonged African] drought and other recent weather anomalies with a global cooling trend and changes in atmospheric circulation which, if prolonged, pose serious threats to major food-producing regions of the world.</li>
 <li><b>Text Excerpt</b> - There is reason to believe, for example, that rice was once grown far north of its present boundary in parts of Asia.</li>
 <li><b>Text Excerpt</b> - Some climatologists think that the present cooling trend may be the start of a slide into another period of major glaciation, popularly called an "ice age."  Many other scientists disagree. J Murray Mitchell Jr [...] a world authority on climate change, comments, "We observe these trends, and we know they are real. But we can't find the central tendancy; we just don't know how long they will last."  Mitchell himself suspects that the present cooling trend will reverse itself rather soon.</li>
 <li><b>Text Excerpt</b> - In summary, the current cooling trend may be but a temporary climatic variation, it may lead to another "Little Ice Age," or it may, indeed, signal the death of the present interglacial period. We do not know. We may never know.  Whatever the case, a study of the past reveals that the Earth's climate is highly variable - indeed, that variability is one of its fundamental characteristics. </li>

<h3>Historic Perspective</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Raw Text Excerpt</b> - For most of Earth's history our planet had no permanent ice cover</li>
</ul>

<h3>Actual Hurricane Trends</h3>


<h3>Drought</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Raw Text Excerpt</b> - In India, for example, before the global warming trend of 1890-1940, severe drought struck about once every four years.  With the warming, however, and more abundant monsoon rains, drought came only once every 18 years or so, greatly increasing India's grain production.  Some climatologists think that if the current cooling trend continues, drought will occur more frequently in India - indeed, through much of Asia</li>

Other notes for future writing: 
Temp and co2 are highest ever?
W/m2 of carbon forcing is a large perturbation relative to others?
Earth is delicate feedback loop and life has been destroyed by high co2/temps?
Sea levels are rising?
Best models predict the actual future?
