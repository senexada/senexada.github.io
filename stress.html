<h2> Stress Research </h2>

<ul>
 <li> MRI showing more rumination activity after urban walk vs. rural -- published in National Academy of Science -- <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/28/8567.abstract">Full paper (free)</a> -- <a href="http://www.futurity.org/nature-depression-951762/">A news summary</a> -- <br/> From abstract: <i>a 90-min walk in a natural setting, decreases both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC), whereas a 90-min walk in an urban setting has no such effects on self-reported rumination or neural activity. In other studies, the sgPFC has been associated with a self-focused behavioral withdrawal linked to rumination in both depressed and healthy individuals.</i>

 <li> Blood pressure, anger, and attention span better after rural vs. urban walk -- J of Environmental Psychology -- <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494402001093">Abstract (full article is paywall)</a> -- From abstract: <i>Subsequently walking in a nature reserve initially fostered blood pressure change that indicated greater stress reduction than afforded by walking in the urban surroundings. Performance on an attentional test improved slightly from the pretest to the midpoint of the walk in the nature reserve, while it declined in the urban setting. This opened a performance gap that persisted after the walk. Positive affect increased and anger decreased in the nature reserve by the end of the walk; the opposite pattern emerged in the urban environment. </i>

 <li> Hospital patients with tree views healed faster and used fewer drugs -- Science -- <a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/sites/default/files/resources/2012/10/ulrich.pdf">Full article pdf</a> -- <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nature-that-nurtures/">Mentioned in Sci Am article</a> -- Excerpt: <i>In summary, in comparison with the wall-view group, the patients with the tree view had shorter postoperative hospital stays, had fewer negative evaluative comments from nurses, took fewer moderate and strong analgesic doses, and had slightly lower scores for minor postsurgical complications. </i>

 <li> Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague -- Southern Med Journal -- <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/554566_3">Long excerpt</a> -- Excerpts: <i>A growing body of evidence confirms that noise pollution has both temporary and permanent effects on humans (and other mammals) by way of the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems. These effects begin to be seen with long-term daily exposure to noise levels above 65 dB or with acute exposure to noise levels above 80 to 85 dB</i> -- And: <i> noise that does not interfere with the sleep of subjects may still provoke autonomic responses and secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol. These responses suggest that one can never completely get used to night-time noise.</i>

 <li> World Health Org report on adverse affects of noise -- <a href="http://www.who.int/docstore/peh/noise/guidelines2.html">Full report</a> -- Interesting points: <i> sleep disturbance occurs above 30dB ambient or 45dB abrupt; sound levels above 80dB increase aggressive behavior</i>
