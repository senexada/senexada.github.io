  <span class="dropcap">O</span>nly two of last year's eight attendees made it to Yosemite
  this year for a glorious but warm autumn in the Sierra. What were the upsides and downsides?
  Read on to see.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

<p class="regtext"><b>The Arrival</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
I arrived Fresno 8pm with only carry-on luggage (first time attempting it;
simply gave up on packing a knife).  Bill picked me up, we slept
in Fresno, and were driving north to Wawona at 624a on Thu Oct 3.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Along the way we discussed my new equipment this year: the KS Ultralight pack.
It weighs one pound and has a minimal frame.  Way lighter than
an REI pack, just as comfortable, yet also cheaper than REI, despite
being custom hand-sown by a sole proprietor in one of the costliest places
on earth (Japan). Which begs the big-box retail question explored by <i>Flight of the Conchords</i> in <i>Think About It</i>:
<a href="https://youtu.be/TLEK0UZH4cs?t=84">
"What are your overheads?"
</a>
</p>

<blockquote class="regtext">
They're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers.<br>
But what's the real cost?<br>
'Cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper.<br>
Why are we still paying so much for sneakers<br>
When you got them made by little slave kids -<br>
What are your overheads?
</blockquote>

<p class="regtext">
  The ranger station at Wawona Hotel was empty (arriving half hour after
  they opened, we dodged the 8-person opening rush). The ranger surprised
us with his bear advice, so different than the northern rockies: sleep
  *near* your bear cans; act aggressively toward bears, as if the bear is
  a big raccoon; but don't stone them to death,
  which accidentally happened in a Lord of the Flies frenzy recently (oops).
   He also surprised us with the forecast: close to 100 degrees at Hetch Hetchy.
</p>


<p class="regtext">
  A juvenile bear skittered across the parking lot as we arrived at White Wolf
  at 10a. We took our starting photo and began the dirt road walk toward Harden Lake.
</p>

<p class="caption">White Wolf parking lot</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    After passing Harden Lake (not particularly scenic), we admired the trailsmanship of the
    switchbacks down the south rim of the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne.
The first few miles had no veiws; at one point we got a few glimpses of the deep blue waters
  of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (but only Bill's phone has that photo?); as we got lower, the views
  pointed toward Pate Valley and Rancheria Mountain.
  </p>

  <div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2024-Yosemite/i-MfjvDW4/0/KgqBqDnrmsWVjWH5Qx9MQmXRQmb9P9JT6vNSTTBP8/4K/IMG_1567-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">Rancheria Mountain</p></div>

<p class="regtext">       
    It was an unusual backcountry entry: a net 3500' of elevation *loss* as we descended
    from the Tioga Road highlands into the furnace of Tuolumne canyon.
    Along the canyon floor we took multiple breaks to soak our shirts in the
    river.
    </p>

<p class="regtext">   
    We crossed the two good bridges in Pate Valley and found a shady campsite in the
    tall pines. It was dark by 7:15p, which foreshadows our biggest challenge of
    this October trip: staying awake until a reasonable bedtime.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
We woke about 620a to maximally benign conditions: about 60F,
no wind, no moisture anywhere, not even a hint of dew.
It is so easy to manage gear like this, compared to last year's
constant hail/rain/snow in Wyoming.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The only "problem" was our ham coldcuts intended for lunch, which had been
at ambient 60F+ for the last 12 hours.  We reasoned that they
were probably fine, but better to sizzle & eat now than wait another
6 hours at daytime temps approaching 90.  Weeks later we consulted
the most reliable part of current year internet -- the message boards --
which verified that we were indeed still alive and unharmed.
(Feel free to skip the blockquotes if you uninterested in bacterial
toxin production)
</p>

<blockquote class="regtext">
<a href="https://www.quora.com/I-left-a-packet-of-ham-out-for-8-hours-in-the-cupboard-by-mistake-Is-it-still-safe-to-eat">
  Quora thread</a><br>
  Vegetative cells (e.g. E. coli, Salmonella, etc.) are all destroyed by proper cooking,
  just as you do with poultry. No toxin-producer affects raw meat in 8 hrs.
  The only thing that grows rapidly on raw meat is SPOILAGE organisms.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="regtext">
  <a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/14489/can-i-re-cook-a-ham-that-was-left-out-overnight">
    Stack Exchange thread</a><br>
For example. at 10C (50F), E. coli only manages to divide once every 8 hours or so 
(see Ratkowsky et al., "Relationship Between Temperature and Growth Rate of Bacterial Cultures", J. Bacteriology, vol 169, p. 1 (1982)<br><br>

Edit: In response to a comment about bacterial toxin production, I want to reiterate 
that colder temperatures slow down metabolism of just about everything, including toxin production.
This is because, at a basic physical level, reaction rates are governed by the Arrhenius
equation which translates, for simple reactions, to a doubling of reaction rates for ~10C increase in temperature.
Of course, organisms like bacteria have more complex interactions, but this still gives an order of magnitude estimate.<br><br>

	    Furthermore, research has been done on production of bacterial toxins.
	    For example, Skinner & Larkin (J. Food Protection vol 61 p. 1154 (1998))
	    wrote a paper called "Conservative Prediction of Time to Clostridium botulinum Toxin
	    Formation for Use with Time-Temperature Indicators To Ensure the Safety of Foods",
	    which gives, for food innoculated with the bacteria, a time-to-detection-of-toxin
	    of 2-3 days at 10C. In fact, they did the research because food storage at open-face
	    refigerators in stores often allows products to get up to as high as 10C (at least as of 1998).<br><br>

Similarly, in Bonventre and Kempe ("Physiology of Toxin Production by Clostridium botulinum
Types A and B, III"), their 10-18C toxin line is flat for 24 hours at the baseline
level before creeping up by a factor of 3 or so between 24 and 48 hours (figure 4).
These are just examples, but you find the same general trends everywhere because
of the fundamental physical relationship between reaction rates and temperature.

<p class="regtext">
  Walking by 812a, we hoped to ascend the +3500' while it was mostly shaded.
  The angel of the sun and color of the leaves made it feel like autumn.

<p class="regtext">    
    It took 3.5 hours (including all breaks) of steady climbing to reach the trail junction to Rodgers Canyon.
    This section had no water except a tiny seeping stream at the junction, barely enough to harvest.
    We couldn't find the pond it supposedly drains. We ate lunch atop the ridge with a stiff breeze and
    quaking aspens.

<p class="regtext">    
    The next two hours were pretty standard Sierra terrain, mostly downhill, but including a long hot stretch
    through what felt like a rolling sea of granite knolls. We left the trail
    at Piute Creek, going upstream through some dead pine forest followed by a great
    ledge scramble toward Saddle Horse Lake.  We erred right and cliffed out near
    the Lake Irwin stream, which travels through an impassable gorge. Then we retreated
    and soon reached the saddle at the foot of Saddle Horse Lake.

<p class="regtext">    
    Next was a short but intense bushwack through dense foliage and deadfall along
    the west side of Saddle Horse Lake. 
    Within five minutes we found game trails, which we followed to an aspen-lined
    meadow on the northwest side near its head. It felt like no one had visited
    in a long time; there were no obvious trails, campsites, fire rings,
    or signs of use. We settled among some boulders, cooked jambalaya,
    and watched the pastel California sunset.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>
  
    
<p class="regtext">
The night was lovely, dark, and deep -- new moon for the win.
It was also much cooler, probably about 40F. We watched the valley
come alive with chirps, calls, and rustling as the low October
rays filtered through the aspens about 8am.  I think of aspens as
a Colorado & Utah tree; it was rewarding to see them here, on the verge
of turning yellow.
</p>

<p class="caption">Campsite at dawn</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
    Last night we decided to do an easy day hike to allow flexibility for
    a more efficient exit, yielding time for a shower and In'n'Out.
    We planned to scout the north shore of Saddle Horse Lake and climb
    the hill on its southeast side.
</p>
<p class="regtext">    
    I love the contrast of these trips.  Today we had warm, gentle, dry
    October sun without an insect or a hint of moisture, not even dew.  Last year on day three in Wyoming
    we had rain, multiple hail storms, and high winds.  Each is inspiring in
    its own way.
</p>
<p class="regtext">    
    Our short day hike was pretty brushy and ledgy.

<p class="caption">Unnamed hill SE of Saddle Horse</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
  It offered nice views north toward Benson Lake and the PCT (neither visible here).
  Pleasant Valley is not an ordinary "valley" in the sense of having a clear valley floor.
  It is surrounded by ridges & peaks, but there is no clear floor. Instead there are
  ridges and gorges and knolls that limit the sight lines and disrupt the sense of place.

<p class="caption">Looking North from high point near Saddle Horse</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
    We observed our off-trail travel speed varying by something approaching 10x.
    Smooth, flat rock was as fast as on trail, while scrambling through underbrush,
    ledges, and deadfall could take an hour for each 1/3 to 1/2 mile.

<p class="caption">Bill at midday on Saddle Horse Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
    Our short hike finished by 1115a and rather than stay another night, we lounged at
    the lake and then backtracked a couple miles to Table Lake. The ledges were much easier on the way
    down: when routing away from the dry creek and westward, 
    there were nice ramps between the ledges.  As the terrain flattened, we reached a large
    work camp (currently uninhabited) that didn't offer any views, but did offer some
    peaceful cascading pools sized for swimming.
</p>

<p class="regtext">    
    Back on trail at Piute creek, we recrossed the hot, strange topography then
    scouted for Table Lake, which we found within 3 minutes
    of leaving the trail. Finding the optimal campsite along the south shore
    took a few more minutes.  The map shows some marsh & swamp, but we had a nice
    dry site with no detectable marsh or bugs. It was really quite a fabulous
    mix of dry, flat ground, open skies, and just enough foliage to feel comfy
    and protected.

  Soon we were in full sun, hotter by the step, with heat shimmering
  off every granite wall.  We encountered our first person since day one,
  a solo hiker on a week-long trek.

  We stopped to eat and swim in the wonderfully cold water of the
  Tuolumne at a swimming hole beneath the bridge.  This was the
  first "busy" part of our trip, with six people passing as we ate,
  and another few as we hiked down valley.
</p>
<p class="regtext">  
  Two bears, a mother and cub, were foraging 10 yards from the trail
  and largely ignored us until I tried to get a photo, at which point
  they showed enough interest that I chose to walk away. We continued
  through the last bits of fast, level, shady trail.

  We debated whether to stop at Morrison Creek, to continue to
  Harden Lake, or to hike all the way to the car at White Wolf.
  By 430p we had hiked about 12 miles, up and down 3000'+ of
  vertical, in intense heat, which was plenty for me.  We found
  a great hollow below the trail, made ramen, and watched the
  clouds & colors develop over the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne.

  Saturday, Aug 5 -- by 7am, Pinedale Airport was around 41 degrees; Steve was still naked while
  everyone else was in the hall with gear.  We got a quick breakfast and lunch-to-go at Heart and
  Soul Diner and we were driving by 8:20 on a clear, sunny, beautiful morning.  (Note for future years:
  the diner got busier by 8am; it's good we started early).
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  We reached the Scab Creek Trailhead at 9am: a pit toilet, no people but us, and 14 cars in the small lot plus some trailers in the stock
  area.  We broke the scale after weighing Alex at 41 lbs and Steve at 43.  We snapped our group photo and headed uphill and immediately left,
  which switched back to the east atop the ridge.

    The first two hours were non-eventful. There was decent shade, decent views behind us, but nothing noteworthy ahead -- just a modestly uphill trail through
    forest, with some stock poop and flies.

      And really, the next four hours were more of the same: generally uphill, modest grade, forested, not much to see. Trail quality varied from fine to
      mucky and unattractive. We passed a few ponds, then
      ate lunch at Divide Lake -- campable (though not particularly scenic) and the first easy water so far. 
      We had passed one group fishing, one camped at Divide, and one outbound.

      We quickly worked across the meadow and its three shin-deep crossings and made Crescent Lake within a half hour. Despite a forecast
      of rain and frequently audible thunder, we had remained dry.  The local wood was not so dry and it took 1.5 hours til the coals were
      ready for cooking.  Starting our appetizers around 6:30, the last steaks came off the fire around 8:00, just as the sun was falling
      behind the ridge.

      The meal produced a discussion of its own.  Pilaf, creamed spinach, polenta, hybrid wagyu, spicy edamame, key lime pies, and vegan macaroons:
      Roger and I declared it our best steak dinner of the year.  Steve declared it his #14.  The rest said solidly a top-5 meal of the year.
      And we had the timeless debate, as yet unresolved, about 4 vs 8 key lime pies.

    <p class="regtext">
      It turned out to be a beautiful day and night despite the always threatening rain.  We had a great site, open yet sheltered, with
      views across Crescent Lake to Mount Bonneville.  The Mosquito Dome even seemed to be working. The map showed 9 miles of travel; GPS showed 10.

    <p class="regtext">
      The rain finally came before dawn -- we were nearly in a fog, with a gentle pitter-patter that induced my best sleep of the night.
      John and Bill were already awake when I got up at 6:30. Though still cloudy and damp, it didn't rain during the breakfast taco
      prep, and we even got a few bits of glorious sun around 10:00.  The dampness made for really slow packing, and we weren't walking
      until after 11:00.

      Taking the south trail around Dream Lake required a lengthy and dicey rock-hop, which all survived.  Dream Lake was a slate

	We saw one section hiker as we briefly crossed the CDT (Continental Divide Trail), a veritable highway in these environs, though only 18 inches
	wide.  Then we followed the clear and quality usage trail along the north side of the stream that drains Bonneville lakes. The valley has some
	thick willows, so the trail was essential for quick travel. It delivered us to an outstanding spot on Bonneville Lake 10521: a lake fed by waterfalls
	and nestled in a 2000 foot deep valley.  We had the whole place to ourselves: we saw no one on this stretch, or really all day,
	except for the one hiker on the CDT.

      I slept poorly due to the foam mat on rocky ground, and thus was awake early enough to beat even Bill,
      who seems to always be wandering around camp before I'm moving.  The two waterfalls and some chirping
      birds were the soundtrack to the dusty pink dawn behind the peaks. Moments like this are why I do it.

      There are times -- when cold, exhausted, with altitude headache, sleeping poorly, neck aching -- when I wonder if it's
      worth it.  Then God provides a morning like this.  I walked 18k steps yesterday and 27k the day before, just five months
      after breaking my kneecap, and I've had no pain.  The past two days had numerous throwbacks to prior years: Dancing
      Bear wine, like our first night in Glacier; the Highline above Dream Lake, like Siberian Outpost; this morning's pink
      dawn, like East Lake in King's Canyon; the trout fishing, like we had hoped for in Golden Trout. The setting was magical
      for reflection.

	  Rain seemed imminent
	  but again spared our breakfast.  Then Bill, John, Steve and I departed up-valley for a day hike to Sheila Lake.
	  It felt destined to rain (or worse) at any moment, but the day hike wasn't going to hike itself.

	<p class="regtext">
	  Ten minutes into the hike, as we finished a talus field on the north side of our lake, the hail arrived
	  in earnest.  We each sheltered in various shrubs from the pea- to marble-sized hail. When the worst had
	  passed, we resumed travel and found Steve, who had run ahead in shorts and t-shirt, shivering
	  in a copse of trees.  The wind chill was probably in the 20s when the front blew through.

	The clouds lifted as quickly as they had dropped, until they settled on the ridgetops. We resumed the journey to the uppermost Bonneville lake.
	We didn't find any clear trail after this point; we scrambled up the ledges on the north side of the stream.

	  After a long rocky traverse of the Bonneville lakeshore, then a gentle climb, we reached Sheila Lake.  Steve scrambled a good ways up the

	  We returned along the north shore of upper Bonneville and were surprised to find three hikers sunning at its outlet.
	  We said hello and crossed to the south side of the outlet, thinking it would be gentler than the ledges we had scrambled
	  to get up the valley.  But it turned out to be thick with willows and almost certainly slower & more difficult, both in the
	  upper and lower reaches.

	  Episodes of wind and rain interrupted dinner; at one point two people held a tarp over Suhas as he shaped the pizza dough.
	  It took about three hours to cook all the pizzas -- but they were amazing, and we ate them during the golden hour when a
	  bit of welcome sunshine appeared.  
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      It was a great day. The day hike was interesting but not too hard.  It was magical to experience the hail storm and the
      mountains shrouded in mist.
    </p>

	<p class="regtext">
	  The final discussions were about -- you may have guessed -- bombing out the next day.
	  The cold winds, rain, hail, and snow had softened our party's resolve.
	  A wet morning would almost certainly slow us enough to dissuade an early exit, but
	  if the morning proved dry, who knew what would happen.  An interesting wrinkle is that
	  I had genuinely lost the best map on day two.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Four</b></p>

    <p class="regtext">
      The morning was misty. We cooked oatmeal in light rain.  All gear was wet so an early departure -- and thus early exit --
      seemed unlikely.
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      Then at 10:00 glorious sunshine appeared and the drying commenced.  The motivated members were packing and walking
      in 20 minutes, with the rest of us trickling out after.  We made a rapid descent to the CDT, then retraced our
      off-trail route between Dream and Raid lakes.

      We decided to head southwest, off-trail, toward trail 7110.  It was a good choice: direct, easy terrain, and only
      one small stream crossing.  As we touched trail 7110 we passed an old cabin with a phenomenal view.

      As we continued downhill in the forest it began to rain -- first a little, then a lot.  We had more hail and a little snow,
      then steady rain for an hour.  The trail was a mess.  Surprisingly we saw quite a few groups of people and stock heading inbound.

	  We had skipped lunch. By 2:20 those of us in the rear reached the huddled, drenched, cold, and hungry leaders.  Having stopped
	  moving for a few minutes, they were near shivering.  And they had voted already without us.  Which kind of makes sense for a wet,
	  shivering crowd.  There was no compelling reason to set camp in these conditions.
    </p>

        <p class="regtext">
	  So we walked another four hours, reaching our cars at 6:15, having taken 38k steps for the day (and my knee: still good).
	  And true to the Winds, the weather changed again: skies were clear and dry by the end.

<p class="regtext"><b>Retrospective</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  The Winds have a wild reputation that we witnessed firsthand: furious rain and hail storms, and even snow, interleaved with
  gentle sunny moments.  Several times I was the coldest I've been in years: wearing every piece of clothing, yet damp
  and on the verge of shivering.  The running shoe is suboptimal in those conditions.  The rain and wind prompted another
  early exit, but the trip was nevertheless a success, with plenty of memorable and brilliant episodes.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  The Winds also have a reputation for summer crowds and summer mosquitos, both of which we largely avoided.  The busiest stretch was from the trailhead to the meadows,
  where we passed multiple parties of people and stock in both directions.  On the middle days we were mostly alone, with no stock and
  very few people.  Getting off the officially-maintained trails seems to do wonders.  The Great Outdoor Shop told us that we got lucky
  on the mosquitos, with a freeze that killed them early this year.  It would be fun to explore this area after Labor Day, though doing so would
  require more cold-weather preparation.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Gear notes:</b>
<ul class="regtext">
  <li>John's Mosquito Dome might have actually worked</li>
  <li>Foam seat is useful when everything is damp</li>
  <li>I think I'll switch back to inflatable pad</li>
  <li>Backup map is important: I lost our primary</li>
  <li>John's Sea To Summit Ultra Sil daypack looked pretty great</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Strategy/Logistics notes:</b>
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li>Our food needs are diminishing with age</li>
    <li>This particular trailhead had exceptionally easy access (road quality)</li>
</ul>

<b>Fuel usage:</b> 
8 people, 3 nights, steaks and some pizzas on campfire: used 4 (maybe 4.5) x 8oz isobutane
</p>



<p class="regtext">
<b>Food: 8 people</b>
<ul class="regtext">
  <li><b>steaks and sides</b> -- 25oz pilaf, 2x 11oz creamed spinach, 1x 16oz polenta, olive oil, 8x 9oz hybrid wagyu, 2x 15oz edamame, 4x key lime pies, 4x vegan macaroons, 2(?) bottles wine. Tons of food. We finished it all, but barely.</li>
  <li><b>breakfast tacos</b> -- 16 large eggs, 1lb bacon, 16 tortillas, 16oz shredded cheese, 2oz hot sauce, salt+pepper, 1x small onion. Good amount.</li>
  <li><b>lunchmeat pitas</b> -- 28oz pitas, 32oz turkey, 16oz cheese slices, 0.5 small onion, 4 roma tomato, 2 avocado, mustard powder, italian seasoning. Way too much. Don't bring pitas; people prefer tortillas, maybe just 1 each. 3/4 the meat/cheese is adequate. Prefer real mustard and real mayo.</li>
  <li><b>pesto pasta?</b> -- don't have notes</li>  
  <li><b>pancakes</b> -- Bill's recipe. Just right.</li>
  <li><b>cheese, crackers, meat</b> -- Bill's amounts. Just right. Always looks small but is deceptively filling.</li>  
  <li><b>pizzas</b> -- Suhas's recipe. I have it somewhere but haven't posted it online yet. Filling & perfect.</li>
  <li><b>oatmeal</b> -- per person: 2oz oats, 1T chia, 1.5T brown sugar, pinch salt, 1oz raisins, 1oz walnuts. On the light side.</li>  
</ul>
