* TFP thread on Polaris 280 slowness - [link][polaris]

I've had a polaris for 16 years and have had the problem you describe on three occasions. Once it turned out to be the relief valve in the wall fitting. It was leaking too much water. I called polaris and they sent me a new valve, but it leaked as much as the first one. I ended up removing the valve and replacing it with a plug. That cured the problem and the plug is still installed.

The next time the problem was a leaking swivel. Guess it just wore out and started leaking. I replaced the swivel and that fixed the problem.

The last time was caused by a small crack in the backup valve housing. The crack was letting enough water leak by to interfere with the operation.

So every time I've had a problem with the polaris not performing like it should there has been a leak some where in the system. The leak from the swivel was not very large, but it sure made a big difference in the operation. Same with the relief valve. I could put my hand around the valve and feel just a little water getting out but that was enough to make the polaris act funky.

with building a jet fighter prototype in 180 days to match the new German fighter planes.
He selected around 50 design engineers and shop mechanics and rented out a circus tent because space
was limited at the Lockheed factory. The tent was set up next to a smelly plastics factory—hence the Skunk Works nickname. 
Johnson’s team delivered the plane, the P-80 Shooting Star, 37 days ahead of schedule." -
