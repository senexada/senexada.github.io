<h2>Reading List</h2>

<ul>
 <li>General Patton: A Soldier's Life -- Hirshson -- <i>The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.</i></li>

 <li>Patton: War as I knew it -- Patton -- <i>In case of doubt, attack.</i></li>

 <li>The Curmudgeon's Guide to Getting Ahead -- Charles Murray -- <i>Being nice means behaving in ways that have immediately pleasant consequences. Being good means behaving in ways that contribute to the welfare of your fellow human beings. Sometimes being nice and being good call for the same behaviors, but often they do not.</i></li>

 <li> The Right Stuff -- Tom Wolfe</li>

 <li> Odyssey -- Homer -- <a href="http://www.editoreric.com/greatlit/translations/Odyssey.html">Web page comparing translations</a>
 <ul>

   <li>Lattimore (1967) - hexameter, faithful, majestic - Tell me, Muse, of the man of many ways, who was driven // far journeys, after he had sacked Troy's sacred citadel. // Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of, // many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea, // struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions.</li>

   <li>Chapman (1616) - pentameter, archaic - The Man, O Muse, informe that many a way // Wound with his wisedome to his wished stay; That wandered wondrous farre when He the towne // Of sacred Troy had sackt and shiverd downe. // The cities of a world of nations, // With all their manners, mindes and fashions, // He saw and knew; at Sea felt many woes, // Much care sustaind, to save from overthrowes // Himself and friends in their retreate for home.</li>

   <li>Pope (1725) - rhymed pentameter, very paraphrased - The man for wisdom's various arts renown'd, // Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; // Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall // Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, // Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray'd, // Their manners noted, and their states survey'd, // On stormy seas unnumber'd toils he bore, // Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore</li>

   <li>Mandelbaum (1990) - pentameter, lines shuffled for readability - Muse, tell me of the man of many wiles, // the man who wandered many paths of exile // after he sacked Troy's sacred citadel. // He saw the cities - mapped the minds - of many; // and on the sea, his spirit suffered every // adversity - to keep his life intact, to bring his comrades back.</li>

   <li>Fitzgerald (1961) - unrhymed irregular lines - Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story // of that man skilled in all ways of contending, // the wanderer, harried for years on end, // after he plundered the stronghold // on the proud height of Troy. // He saw the townlands // and learned the minds of many distant men, // and weathered many bitter nights and days // in his deep heart at sea, while he fought only // to save his life, to bring his shipmates home.</li>

   <li>Cook (1967) - loosely hexameter, line for line match, linguistically accurate - </li>
