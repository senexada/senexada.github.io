<p class="regtext">O Canada! Full of surprises. As usual, click photos for high res versions.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="regtext">The drive through Banff is spectacular. Glacier after glacier, creek after creek, turqouise lake after turquoise lake, all visible from the roadside of the Tranny-Can Highway. You could spend the entire summer exploring this place without getting bored.</p>

<p class="regtext">Our stop for breakfast and bear spray in Lake Louise is barely worth mentioning, but for some foreshadowing. The sporting goods employees explained in minute detail how to use the spray. Apparently some Fairmont guests think that bear spray is like mosquito spray, which you spray on yourself before hiking. Yikes. We assured them that we were veritable experts in the use of bear spray and would not do anything dumb.</p>

<p class="regtext">We followed the Icefields Parkway, with similarly spectacular scenery, to our hike&#8217;s exit point at Norman Lake trailhead. In another bit of foreshadowing, the parking lot was unnamed and barely even marked. We dropped the cars and shuttled another 20 miles to our starting point at Nigel Pass trailhead.</p>

<p class="regtext">The entry hike was as good as it gets: sunny, still, and gently climbing up the valley:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-HNVFCCT/0/X3/IMG_2127-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-HNVFCCT/0/M/IMG_2127-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Up Nigel Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">After lunch in warm stillness, we finished the mild climb to Nigel Pass. Looking back down the valley we could see the Tranny Can 5 miles in the distance, including the occasional glint from a passing car.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-78k3VMh/0/X3/IMG_2142-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-78k3VMh/0/M/IMG_2142-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Looking back on the first 5 miles (and the road in the distance)</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Nigel Pass is the start of Jasper park. After fording the Brazeau we immediately turned upriver towards the Brazeau headwaters. The scenery transformed almost instantly from verdant meadows to stark rock &amp; silty glacial streams.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-X3Qp2bT/0/X3/IMG_2146-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-X3Qp2bT/0/M/IMG_2146-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Up Brazeau River</p></div>

<p class="regtext">After passing a surprising number of people (at least 3 groups of 6+) we reached the final climb to Cataract Pass. There was a faint track up the rocky face, which was steep and relentless but didn&#8217;t require scrambling. JC, as usual, was first to the top and photographed the rest of us.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-jkKcZx2/0/X3/IMG_2148-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-jkKcZx2/0/M/IMG_2148-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Cataract Pass (looking north)</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The pass marked our transition into Alberta&#8217;s White Goat Wilderness, which is as lightly managed as wilderness gets (more on that later). We descended perhaps a mile or two into upper Cataract Valley, which is a huge rolling meadow, several miles across, full of pica and wildflowers, criss-crossed by bubbling streams, and ringed by peaks and glaciers. We chose a spot near the western edge.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-bT6zQ93/0/X3/IMG_2153-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-bT6zQ93/0/M/IMG_2153-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">First campsite, Cataract Meadow</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We were surprised to share the meadow with at least 3 other groups. We weren&#8217;t elbowing each other, given the dispersed sites over the multi-square-mile meadow. But two different rangers had told me to expect to see no one in the White Goat. (Earlier this summer many bridges in southern Jasper were destroyed by floods. My best guess is that hiking parties with Jasper reservations needed to re-route to Cataract Meadow due to Jasper trail closures.)</p>

<p class="regtext">Suhas cooked a pulled pork that would be delicious in a fancy restaurant; the 10 mile hike and alpine setting amplified the delight several fold. We finished as the last rays of sunlight illuminated the continental divide.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-fGdKGpc/0/X3/IMG_2160-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-fGdKGpc/0/M/IMG_2160-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Sunset in Cataract Meadow</p></div>

<p class="regtext">I checked for northern lights each time I awoke that night, but no luck.</p>

<hr/>
<p class="regtext">Day two &#8212; unbeknownst to us, Steve had secured his egg carton overnight with the popular and ingenioustechnique of &#8220;wedging it between two rocks.&#8221; Even so, when he opened it this morning, a solitary egg was absent. Steve had no memory of omitting an eggwhile packing, but was completely unconcerned.</p>

<p class="regtext">After breakfast we discussed a day trip to Valley of the Lakes, which is reached by walking to Cline Pass, then climbing the ridge to the east. One map showed no trail; another showed a &#8220;route;&#8221; and I remembered some vague descriptions from internet searches. Jason lobbied to travel with full packs, to camp in the Valley of the Lakes, and to extend our loop down MacDonald Creek. With hindsight about Idiot&#8217;s Pass, Suhas&#8217;s knees, and Canadian trail data, it&#8217;s good we defeated him.</p>

<p class="regtext">The walk up Cline Pass was easy, and at its saddle a descending pair of hikers described their just-completed route up the unnamed ridge.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-PvFJQPR/0/X3/IMG_2170-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-PvFJQPR/0/M/IMG_2170-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Looking east from Cline Pass up Unnamed Pass</p></div>

<p class="regtext">It was challenging but passable without a pack: steep, mostly scrambling, 100% scree, from golf ball sized up to car-sized boulders.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-m5g87h6/0/X3/IMG_2164-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-m5g87h6/0/M/IMG_2164-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Roger Climbing UnnamedPass</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Roger was wearing his regular (mostly empty) pack, a monstrously big pack that was tall enough to prevent him from tipping his head back steeply to see uphill. With limited vision, and after a few twisted ankles, he and I decided to turn back. We were perhaps 2/3 of the way up? We had this view north into Jasper Park:</p>

<p class="regtext">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-fjL5Zr4/0/X3/IMG_2166-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-fjL5Zr4/0/M/IMG_2166-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Looking North from Cline Pass</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We surfed down the scree and lied in the shade of the boulder in the lower left of the photo above. The others ate lunch on the wind-swept ridge and descended in about an hour. Steve enjoyed the snowfield at the bottom:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-6RCh5jd/0/X3/IMG_2177-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-6RCh5jd/0/M/IMG_2177-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Steve</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We walked across miles of the massive Cataract Meadow in the afternoon sun, back to our campsite.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-W8wh9m3/0/X3/IMG_2184-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-W8wh9m3/0/M/IMG_2184-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Steve Descending Cataract Meadow</p></div>

<p class="regtext">JC cooked a spectacular pasta with the best mushrooms I&#8217;ve ever tasted. We reviewed the day&#8217;s route on our maps and realized that we had climbed a much steeper section than the &#8220;route&#8221; marked on the National Geographic map. Thus Roger named our approach Idiot&#8217;s Pass.</p>

<p class="regtext">We slept early to prepare for the long day, 12-15 miles down an unmaintained trail.</p>

<hr/>
<p class="regtext">Day three &#8212; after a lingering sunrise:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-8BJbJk8/0/X3/IMG_2195-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-8BJbJk8/0/M/IMG_2195-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Sunrise over Cataract Valley</p></div>

<p class="regtext">we pounded a quick oatmeal breakfast and began walking downhill. Our plan was to cover the 12-15 miles (reports vary and the maps are unclear) down Cataract Creek to the shores of Pinto Lake. That distance was especially longbecause, as I understand Canadian wilderness policy, this trail has been unmaintained for at least 10 or 20 years. A few internet comments described the trail as vanishing in the upper valley. Figuring a 4x speed reduction for forested route-finding, we started early and hoped for no more than mile or two of trail hunting.</p>

<p class="regtext">The first mile was in the open meadow, walking the spongy ground among wildflowers.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-bzq4hvr/0/X3/IMG_2206-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-bzq4hvr/0/M/IMG_2206-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Descending Cataract Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Soon the creek widened, the valley narrowed, the forest encroached, and we were battling evergreens, scramblingup and down river banks, fording and fording again, searching unsuccessfully for a trail, and following the river downhill:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-HWRCQZ4/0/X3/IMG_2220-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-HWRCQZ4/0/M/IMG_2220-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Off trail along Cataract Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">One blogger estimated that only a handful of people hike the length of Cataract Creek each year. The Alberta rangers communicated a similar sense. As we put more and more miles between us and every other human in Alberta, the feeling of rugged and beautiful remoteness got stronger and stronger:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-8dF4CQF/0/X3/IMG_2225-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-8dF4CQF/0/M/IMG_2225-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Upper Cataract Creek</p></div>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-PvRLrMN/0/X3/IMG_2217-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-PvRLrMN/0/M/IMG_2217-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">More Cataract highlands</p></div>

<p class="regtext">For a mile or two we found no reliable trail. Segments might appear then vanish in a hundred yards. The maps were useless. We made tolerable time despite constantly searching sideways and debating how many fords were appropriate, and even what side of the river was ultimately best. The black flies were troublesome, not landing often, but when they did, biting fiercely. As the river bank steepened and the river quickened we traveled more and more slowly. Our average pace for several hours was less than a mile per hour.</p>

<p class="regtext">Finally Bill discovered a trail while exploring a tributary on the east side. It was narrow and overgrown. It vanished several times, but after another half hour of lost-and-found we settled into a legitimate and lasting trail. It followed the east side of Cataract Creek, sometimes within sight, sometimes curving away. It passed through huge and copious grizzly diggings and fresh bear droppings. It was obstructed by hundreds of fallen trees throughout its length. It traveled through some open meadows, but mostly through dense, mossy forest with mushrooms the size of dinner plates:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-F7LrHj6/0/X3/IMG_2255-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-F7LrHj6/0/M/IMG_2255-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Big Mushroom</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We walked for miles and miles. We were too focused and forgetful to search for the indian rock paintings along this section. When the valley finally widened we found a trail junction with a vertical post but no sign. Someone had scraped fingernail-sized letters with a paperclip that supposedly pointed toward Pinto Lake (O, Canada, your unmanaged wilderness is truly unmanaged). That trail softened to a game trail within 10 minutes and eventually disappeared, but we continued due westward over moist &amp; mossy ground without a trail until finally, after what felt like miles, we hit the Cataract-Cline confluence.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-8T4cRpc/0/X3/IMG_2262-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-8T4cRpc/0/M/IMG_2262-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Fording Cataract Creek near the Cline confluence</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Being Labor Day, it was flowing gently and less than knee deep. After crossing it we saw another great unmaintained sign, crumbling but still intact:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-XknB2dw/0/X3/IMG_2267-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-XknB2dw/0/M/IMG_2267-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">White Goat Wilderness Official Sign</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We then forded both channels of the Cline River and found a good trail on its south side.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-DsDgbzw/0/X3/IMG_2271-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-DsDgbzw/0/M/IMG_2271-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Looking back across the Cline ford</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We followed the widetrail to Pinto Lake, taking the southern fork along its east shore. Around 7pm we claimed an established campsite with log benches &amp; fire ring. Jason and Bill swam in the setting sun.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-zM5x4JT/0/X3/IMG_2277-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-zM5x4JT/0/M/IMG_2277-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Pinto Lake swimming at sunset</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Alex cooked some tasty jumbalaya and longed for a 5 quart pot (do we want to go big &amp; heavy next year?). Despite the late hour, it was comfortably warm, perhaps due to the lower altitude, perhaps due to the campfire. By 10pm we saw the Milky Way vividly enough to see its structure. Jason and I completed the simple yet rewarding no-flashlight challenge. The night was comfortable; I doubt it even reached 40F.</p>

<hr/>
<p class="regtext">Day four &#8212; the bacon, after three days without refrigeration, was as tasty as ever. The hardier members took turns tending it with forks over an intense fire, scalding their arm hair.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-2BCjVVN/0/X3/IMG_2301-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-2BCjVVN/0/M/IMG_2301-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">Bacon</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Alex proclaimed &#8220;the juxtaposition of this trip and Vegas is so awesome. It increases the value of each substantially!&#8221; Bill&#8217;s berry pancakes were superb.</p>

<p class="regtext">Jason and I departed for Waterfall Valley, leaving the others to wallow in lethargy. The unmarked but obvious trail follows the main stream that feeds Pinto Lake from its southwest. Below the treeline it was shady and cool; above it was a mile or two of shadeless rocky tundra</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-b2L2S2d/0/X3/IMG_2307-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-b2L2S2d/0/M/IMG_2307-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">JC climbing unnamed pass SW of Pinto Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The pass was broad and not particularly steep. We travelled about half a mile beyond it, across the plateau, to a lunch spot overlooking Waterfall Valley.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-SNLDrQk/0/X3/IMG_2330-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-SNLDrQk/0/M/IMG_2330-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">JC above Waterfall Valley</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Our lunch and subsequent nap were ideal: warm sunshine, 70 degrees, wispy clouds, an occasional gentle breeze, all amidst a 4000&#8242; deep valley and tens of thousands of acres of personal space.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-7hnCD4f/0/X3/IMG_2336-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-7hnCD4f/0/M/IMG_2336-M.jpg" alt=""/></a><p class="caption">The ideal afternoon</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The return was nearly all downhill and was very fast (only 2+ hours?). Partway below the treeline we found a developed campsite above &amp; east of the trail, at the spot marked on the National Geographic map. It looked recently used, with piles of firewood and a pair of forgotten boots. It would make a good stopover on the way into Waterfall Valley from Norman Lake.</p>

<p class="regtext">As we approached our campsite I told Jason that hearing about such a perfect hike would make the others sorry for choosing a lounging, wasteful day. But as we entered camp, they demonstrated the only possible thing that could make <em>us</em> the jealous ones: their homemade raft, built caveman-style with rock tools.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="http://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-rvPtG6M/0/X3/raft1-X3.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2013/2013-09-Banff/i-rvPtG6M/0/M/raft1-M.jpg" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">&#8220;Me cut log&#8221;</p></div>

<p class="regtext">I cannot recreate the discussions, but at some point Alex threw down the gauntlet: he found two arm-size logs, lashed them together, tossed them in the lake, and declared that tool-free raft construction had just been proven in concept. Their next goal was to cross Pinto Lakeby raft.</p>

<p class="regtext">The 8-inch main beams were challenging to cut without tools. Their two most impressive brute force techniques were (a) axe-like chopping with a rock held in bare hands and (b) hoisting and dropping an even bigger log on the transverse beam. They created an actual floating raft that was paddled by a frying pan lashed to a stick. It didn&#8217;t cross the lake but it provided a few joy rides.</p>

<p class="regtext">This being the last evening of the trip, we finished with our traditional Roger pesto pasta. Earlier Bill and Roger had scouted a bit of the exit trail, so we went to bed anticipating an easy 8 miles on trail, with an initial ascent but then mostly downhill, getting us to the cars by lunchtime.</p>

<hr/>
<p class="regtext">Day Five &#8212; the morning was cloudy and cool. We ate quickly, packed quickly, and were on trail around 730am. The sunrise illuminated the mountain above Huntington Creek.</p>

<p class="regtext">We followed the lake shore west and forded where the Cline River originates from Pinto Lake.</p>

<p class="regtext">The ford ended at a well-developed campsite with outhouse, benches, tables, and a sign. Bill and Roger had scouted this far and very logically had concluded that such a well developed sight would be on a well-developed trail. Thus began our biggest fail.</p>

<p class="regtext">Several trails led out from the sight, but each one mellowed, turned to a game trail, then disappeared entirely within 5 minutes. We tried several trails, backtracking and bushwacking, never finding a convincing trail in the proper direction. In retrospect, the trail heading down the Cline, directly away from our exit pass, might have eventually joined the official trail. Or we could have backtracked across the Cline a mile or two to the signed divergence that we had passed on day three. But two maps and GPS clearly showed that the official trail ran close to the lake, south of the White Goat boundary, so traversing between the boundary and the lakeshore looked like an obvious way to locate the trail without backtracking.</p>

<p class="regtext">We travelled from lake to boundary several times and never found the trail. We could see the pass, and the horizontal distance was close &#8212; less than a mile &#8212; so instead of backtracking for a trail that might not exist, we began to bushwack generally uphill towards the pass.</p>

<p class="regtext">The forest was thick. Our next mile took about three hours of constant movement, climbing over deadfall, crawling under branches, scraping arms and legs and faces and packs. After numerous switchbacks we resolved to hike directly up a slide area with short but dense firs. The slope exceeded 45 degrees in spots and the only secure footing was on the uphill side of tree trunks.</p>

<p class="regtext">The direct climb was actually quite fun and finally felt productive after hours of switchbacks in the mossy deep shade of the high canopies. This shot looks back downhill and illustrates the steepness of the climb:</p>

<p class="regtext">Atop this segment the slope opened into a rolling treeless area that was one small ridge below the pass. The relief! We were giddy. We sat down for a well deserved rest and snack. Alex and I pulled out a map to evaluate the northern vs. southern route around the final ridge. And then it happened.</p>

<p class="regtext">I was not quite conscious, but my stream of perceptions were a hiss, a burning in my chest and nose, Alex leaping up and shouting, Steve coughing, the smell, more burning, and finally, the realization that we&#8217;d been bear sprayed. By me.</p>

<p class="regtext">Roger water-boarded Alex with quart after quart of water while Alex shouted that he couldn&#8217;t see. Steve, being downwind of us, had inhaled it, and languished through waves of nausea. I paced in a stupor, unable to speak until the nasal burning subsided.</p>

<p class="regtext">It eventually subsided, and after 20 minutes I felt quite invigorated. I also figured out what had happened. I carry the bear spray in the cargo pocket of my pants. A tree branch had extracted the safety during our bushwack. As I sat down with Alex my pant fabric briefly pressed the trigger. Thank God it was less than one second. It blasted up my shirt sleeve, under my chin &amp; nose, and into Alex&#8217;s face. The wind carried the cloud 50 feet to Steve.</p>

<p class="regtext">We finally collected ourselves and completed a respectable climb/scramble up the terraced ridge to our south. You can see several of us in the high res photo:</p>

<p class="regtext">A pleasant pair of Canadian hikers spied our route up the ridge. Roger apologized for ruining their serenity with our keystone cop routine: &#8220;first we got lost, then we bushwacked for hours, then we bear sprayed each other, then we shouted for a while, &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p class="regtext">We spent only a few minutes at Sunset Pass, looking back toward Pinto Lake &amp; the Cline valley.</p>

<p class="regtext">It was now past noon. We were 4 hours behind schedule. Steve, despite his experience with tear gas, was still fighting nausea. My armpit and chest were burning hotter and hotter. And Suhas&#8217;s knee pain, which he had mentioned on the ascent, had become intolerable.</p>

<p class="regtext">We somehow finished the 6 miles back to the parking lot. Suhas stoically continued via a combination of walking sticks, painkillers, leaning-on-shoulders, and brute determination. Steve recovered enough to assist Suhas while the rest of us shuttled their packs. My capsaicin burns disabled me with nausea by the bottom.</p>

<p class="regtext">I only have one photo from the descent:</p>

<hr/>

<p class="regtext">The two bits of earlier foreshadowing, about improper use of bear spray and poorly marked trails, proved true. We later found someone&#8217;s GPS waypoints descending the trail (which does indeed exist) from Sunset Pass to Pinto Lake. His route was substantially different than the one marked on our maps. We concluded (along with our Cataract Creek &amp; Idiot&#8217;s Pass experience) that Canadian trail markings, maintenance, &amp; maps are only marginally reliable.  With that realization and Suhas&#8217;s hobbling, I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t add the 15+ miles of unknown terrain down MacDonald Creek.</p>

<p class="regtext">A few additional notes for the archives: carry more honey stingers, more short lengths of cord, eight stakes for the tarp (not 6), and purel. And don&#8217;t bear spray yourself; it takes a lot of showers to vanquish the burning.</p>
