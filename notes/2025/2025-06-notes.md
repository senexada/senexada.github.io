### OpenSSL stuff

Years ago I encrypted some files with openssl des3:
`openssl des3 -i foo -o foo.des3`

Trying to decrypt in 2025 on a macbook, it failed with _bad decrypt_, even when
I had the right password.

It took an hour or so with AI to figure this out.

* it suggested various options to openssl, like `-legacy` or `-provider legacy` --> these all failed
* it suggested I `brew install openssl@1.1` --> macbook failed to install: "not supported"
* it suggested running in docker --> this actually worked. Steps below.

#### The docker steps that actually worked:

* download docker from `docker.com`
* install docker
* create a docker instance:
    * `mkdir tmp; cd tmp`
    * (copy files into tmp)
    * `docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/data ubuntu:20.04 bash`
    * install openssl 1.1: `apt update && apt install -y openssl`
    * confirm it is 1.1.1f: `cd /data; openssl version`
    * actually decrypt using md5: `openssl des3 -d -in foo.des3 -out foo -md md5`
    * (it took a while to figure out the md5 thing; without it you still get _bad decrypt_)
    * (useful trick from ai: use `-out /dev/null` to isolate password handling from decryption;
       if _bad decrypt_ when using _/dev/null_, then password is wrong, file is corrupted, or
       there was an additional _-salt_ flag or custom digest. AI suggested that custom digest
       might have been md5 back then. I tried it and it worked)
