<h3>Mass conditioning by John Oliver</h3>

<p>Quote from 4chan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The subject of john oliver came up when a colleague (fellow psychologist) and I were discussing
 politics a few months ago. Although we were both in agreement regarding the general shitlib inanity
 of the HBO show, my friend was surprised when I explained that the real insidiousness of it is its
 unmistakably hypnotic structure and pacing.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling up an episode or two off of youtube to show her what I meant.
 All of the segments I've ever seen from this show follow the same repetitive format:
 persent some "argumentation" and "facts" for about 10 seconds, then quickly follow
 these up with a snarky quip (which themselves overwhelmingly take the form of complete
 non-sequitor or otherwise absurd metaphor) before any rational processing of the preceding
 argument can take place in the mind of the viewer. Further telling is that the only 'beats'
 or mental pauses in the show's pacing exist solely to highlight the approving laughter
 or applause of the studio audience.  Repeat this basic formula without variation 20-40 times
 in a row and you have one of the 12-20 minute 'segments' that form the backbone of the show.</p>

<p>The end effect is (obviously) not to deliver information, but rather to literally teach the
 viewers -- on a subconcious level -- to mentally associate derisive laughter with any
 person or opinion that is at odds with the narrative's take on the chosen issue. And it
 accomplishes this by maintaining a strict adherence to a roughly 20-second cycle in which
 a stimulus is presented, and a response is cued. This is the sense in which the show is
 fundamentally hypnotic in effect -- even moreso than its precursors in the genre (Daily Show,
 Colbert, etc).</p>

<p>To my mind, oliver's show is representative of the media's increasing mastery of the
 methodologies of mass conditioning; in fact it is almost such a perfect technical
 accomplishment that I would almost have to admire it on technical grounds, which moreover
 is in the hands of the entirely wrong people.</p>
