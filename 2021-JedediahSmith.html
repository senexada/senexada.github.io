<p class="regtext">
<span class="dropcap">W</span>e hit the west slope of the Tetons in June,
rather than our typical August, minus some usual suspects,
who had been replaced by impressionable minors.  The result of bringing
teenagers: "would do again."
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Thunderstorms disrupted the delicate Denver
airport, causing us to arrive in Idaho Falls at 2am lacking two essential bags.
Instead of driving for the hills on Saturday morning,
we sat in the hotel lobby brainstorming the minimal gear required to salvage
the trip. Thankfully, the missing bags arrived mid morning and we were driving by noon, crossing
the planes of Idaho toward the western Tetons.
</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
<p class="regtext"><b>Day One</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
We dropped one car at our exit, North Leigh trailhead, which is about 20 minutes
off the pavement of Idaho 33.  On this particular Saturday afternoon (June 26) there were eight cars at
the trailhead and one horse trailer.  The seven of us crammed into the canyonero for the hour drive
to Coyote Meadows.
</p>

<p class="caption">The crew, minus our narrator</p></div>


<p class="regtext">
My initial impression from the dozen horse trailers at Coyote Creek was "uh oh, crowds."  
But some groups were already exiting as we began (at 3:10pm), and more crossed our
path during the first hour.  After that, we were alone. 
</p>

<p class="caption">3pm start from Coyote Meadows</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
The hike to Corral Basin was easy, with only two modest uphill climbs. A 12-horse commercial
group passed us outbound at the bridge over North Bitch Creek.  The forest opened to views of
mountains after the halfway point.
</p>

<p class="caption">Approaching Corral Basin</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
Reaching the foot of Corral Basin at 7:40pm, we took the first site after the sign (which 
was ultimately the only obvious site we saw in the Basin).  The fire was roaring in an hour
and our late hamburger dinner spanned the hour after that.  Nathan got a chill that persisted despite 
a 15 degree sleeping bag on a warm evening.  My watch showed 28k steps for the day.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
I awoke to bright daylight at 5:30 and just lazed. Everyone was up by 7:50, the egg tacos were 
consumed by 9:00 (raw onion is heavy but so good), and we were packed and walking by 10:20. Nathan,
thankfully, felt good as new.  Three people on five hourses passed us outbound; they had camped in the
basin last night somewhere out of sight, and were the last people we would see for the next 2+ days.  
</p>

<p class="regtext">
In the first half hour we passed the Camp Lake junction, which showed 4.3 miles to our pass. Immediately
we were slowed by deadfall and the first shoes-off crossing. We continued up the meadows of the unnamed
valley toward Dead Horse Pass.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-FX4csjH/0/X5/i-FX4csjH-X5.jpg">

<p class="caption">Betwixt Corral Basin and Dead Horse Pass</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
We ate lunch beside the second shoes-off crossing, this one about knee deep.  The next 2.5 hours
were steady, shaded switchbacks, frequently hopping streams while hearing the muffled roar of
always-nearby rapids.  At 8400' snow appeared and trail detection became erratic due to 
the snow pack.  We took several breaks en route and reached the snowy pass just after 4pm.
</p>

<p class="caption">Fine spot for a rest. Dead Horse Pass</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
The south side of the ridge, unsurprisingy, had less snow -- barely any -- and a good
switchbacked trail took us quickly down to the river, where we scouted and chose the site
at the junction.  
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Our site was in the trees and by dusk was thick with mosquitos. See the end of this
report for notes on improved pasta logistics.  The offspring did admirably on the first full
day with legit uphill, and on cooking & cleaning.  Gadget showed 23k steps. The evening was warm.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>


<p class="regtext">
True darkness lasted only from about 10pm to 5am.  Another beautiful day in the mountains, another
two hours of teenager-sized batches of pancakes (note: no one eats the walnuts).  Our typical
slow start lent time for the teenages to achieve a level 2 bridge across Badger Creek.
</p>

<p class="caption">Level 2 bridge over Badger Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
We began hiking in earnest about noon. The first few hours had surprisingly steep sections for
a stock trail, and got warm, as it was our first day without shade or clouds.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We ate at the false pass near Crow's Nest, then continued to traverse under the ridgeline, losing 
the trail in the swampy basins.

<p class="regtext">
At an opportune spot (near the 4,854k N UTC grid line), we dropped packs for a ten minute
side trip into Grand Teton park, which offered excellent photo ops of Grand Teton. The
unnamed peak 10,538 east of Littles Peak looks to be a spectacular spot to capture the
full relief of Grand Teton on some future golden hour.  It also looks alluring to do an
exit hike down Leigh Canyon.

<p class="regtext">
Unable to find the trail in the boggy hollow, we lost about half hour on false trails
before finding a true junction and reaching our unnamed lake (the highest lake draining
into Green Lake) at 6pm. This was our best site: glorious oranges, purples, and pinks of sunset
while the kids skipped stones onto a serene lake.  It was a magical evening.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Four</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
Thus far the scenery had improved daily (somewhat expected, given the low altitude forested start), and
today would continue the excellence of day three.
</p>

<p class="caption">Toward Green Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
We first passed a pretty unnamed lake with some good sites, then some small cascades
interspersed with clear pools. We then passed the aptly named
Green Lake, its surface reflecting the verdant slope on its western side, and which flows
out through a beaver dam.
</p>

After topping out, there was a delightful meadow walk while looking down a vertical mile
across green meadows and wooded ridges to the plains of Idaho.  There was a light breeze
and barely a cloud in the sky.  This was a wonderful section to stroll down.

<p class="regtext">
Prior to this stretch, we passed water at least every hour (of the entire trip).  This section had
none. The trail dust was finer at low altitudes and the trail spanned a lot of vertical.
We passed a family and two day hikers
coming inbound, the first people since Corral Basin.  Reaching the river & road, 5 cars were parked;
another five minutes down the road was our car in the larger lot, alone.

<p class="regtext"><b>Retrospective</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
This was a solid showing for our first trip with teenagers. I enjoyed the June timeframe:
copious daylight, lots of active streams, and no wildfires. We possibly got lucky
with warm evenings.  Trail-finding was harder than August due to snowpack.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The final campsite was by far the best, buttressing our previous bias toward lakes over
meadows and streams.  Valley bottom streams have heavy mosquitos and are less scenic.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Mileage and elevations were good. The last two days were most scenic. It was good to do the
final stretch downhill rather than uphill.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The unnamed peak (mentioned in the Teton NP episode) looks to be a unique, spectacular spot to
view and photograph Grand Teton.  It may be worth a return trip, hiking out Mink Lake through
the National Park.  The Teton Crest route also looks appealing.  Some related Teton Crest links:
