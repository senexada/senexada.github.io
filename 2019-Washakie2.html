<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
There is something soothing about the multi-hour pancake ritual on the stationary day.  
While Alex searched for a swimming hole in the untainted wilderness, Steve and I assembled
a river-rock tandoor as a potential pizza oven.
</p>

About 1pm, Jason and I departed to explore Jeff's Buttress (as noted in last night's campsite photo) and beyond.
It did not disappoint.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We reached the buttress itself in just over an hour of steep hiking with a few scrambles.  To the south and east, we saw our
campsite and tomorrow's hike over the unnamed pass at the Higgins headwaters. (You can barely see our tents in the high res version, near the river)
</p>

To the northeast was Burwell Pass, with yesterday's trail zagging down the mountainside.
</p>

And looking west and northwest, the crow can fly 60+ miles before seeing a road. 
Just past the midpoint of that flight, near Hawk's Rest in the Thoroughfare region of Yellowstone,
is the farthest point from a road in the lower 48 states (excluding islands).
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Though remote, the Thoroughfare is a busy area of Yellowstone, popular with outfitters.  
Some summer days register 100+ people and 200+ mules past the ranger cabin <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.
We, in contrast, saw no one for five days in these marvelously scenic adjacent lands.
</p>

Continuing upward from Jeff's Buttress was a delightful, meanindering ridge stroll.  
Some elk eyed us we followed the ridge northwest before descending game trails back
to camp.

Upon our return, the pizza oven was cold, due to abandonment after Bill's midday trial caused a river rock to fracture.
We don't need that type of injury this far from a road.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
But thanks to 2.5 hours (!) of clever pan management , Suhas and his sous chef (Steve) delivered seven
pizzas of superlative quality.  It was such wonderful food in such wonderful setting that I will break my
usual prohibition of millenial-type food pics.

<p class="regtext">
Lacking a better alternative, we gave it a shot.
</p>


<p class="regtext">
We drove into the haze from Best Western Arlington, hoping for favorable winds.  After Darrington, Suiattle River Road
 took us 45 minutes into thickening forest. On this particular Friday morning (Aug 17)
there were 6 cars at the Suiattle River trailhead.  Upon opening the car doors, the sound of rushing water overwhelmed the senses.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
An evocative primordialism pervades the entry hike, a vertical mile below our typical trailheads and near our continent's
only temperate rain forest.  Like Degobah, it shows no signs of civilization but massive lifeform readings. 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The trail, often a yard wide and spongy with pine needles, curves along the milky Suiattle in its long, roaring, continuous rapid.
The mighty trees reach eight feet in diameter and rise to neck-craning heights before disappearing into the canopy.  Their trunks are
among the straightest lines in nature.  Everything is green: the boughs and canopies, the moss on the trunks, the ferns and
lichen on steep hillsides.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The trail steepens after the Canyon Creek suspension bridge then steepens again on Miner's Ridge Trail.  A few rare openings offer a glimpse of Glacier Peak, majestic despite the haze.
</p>



<p class="regtext"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p class="regtext" id="footnote1">[1] Gary Ferguson, <i>Hawks Rest; A Season in the Remote Heart of Yellowstone</i>, Chapter 3 (p. 55): 
<blockquote class="regtext">
Beautiful as it may be, this most remote region in the lower 48 is by far the busiest
slice of backcountry either of us have ever seen. [...] Until late August not a single week
will pass when Hawks Rest isn't wrapped in shouts and whistles and dog barks and horse bells
and beer-soaked snorts and cackles [...] over the next month and a half more than 600 people
will pass, along with two or three times that many horses and mules.
</blockquote>
</p>
</p>




<p class="regtext">
After breakfast we walked the final hour to the crest of Miner's Ridge. This section had no water but copious huckleberries and occasional strawberries.  The smoke thickened until it smelled constantly like campfire.  Meridian sunshine threw the soft pastel shadows of dusk.
</p>


<br/>
<p class="regtext">
At Miner's Ridge lookout we met Russ doing his month-long volunteer stay for hospitality and restoration.  He told us some history of an earlier helicopter crash, the deadfall preventing stock access, the horses that died on the lower trail, and how he drinks unfiltered water.  Visibility at noon was four miles and declining as we finished the ridge walk to Image Lake.
</p>
<br/>


<p class="regtext">
We abandoned our plans for Canyon Lake (another 8-ish miles directly toward the Bannock Lakes fire).  Bill and I scouted ~30 minutes to Lady Camp, which had a clearing about the size of Sunnybrook, though nestled against trees with views of a sloping meadow.  A stream was close but was only trickling. 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We camped at the group site (plenty large) with three couples also in the area.  Russ came by to warn us of a "smoke storm."  As the smoke thickened, the moon glowed weakly orange, the nearest ridges were indistinct, and my eyes and throat began itching.
</p>

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
A browsing deer nearly stepped on JC.  After our two hour pancake ritual, the eight-party talks began.  With even JC unsure about a day hike, things looked grim.  No one was enthusiastic to stay and some were eager to leave.  We decided to do the full ~15 miles, -4600' (net) to the cars.
</p>


<br/>

<p class="regtext">
Poor Russ had a "smoke cold" and warned of lightning and continuing smoke.  We left him our surplus cheese and berries and we hauled some of his trash.  Even in the haze it was pleasing to pick berries on the descent.
</p>

<br/>


<p class="regtext">
Excluding the time talking to Russ and lunching at Canyon Creek, we descended in about six hours.  Twenty people had signed the register since our entry 2.5 days ago.

That's all, folks: an inauspicious ending. We did make it out in time for burgers at the demo-friendly (for me, at least) Natty's Junkyard Grill.
