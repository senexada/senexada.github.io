<hr/><h3>The Case Against K-1 / LPs / 2+20</h3>
2024-11-12<br/><br/>
Basic case is
<ol>
  <li>Returns to ordinary investors do not exceed index fund returns
  </li>
  <li>Tax complexity/cost is high
  </li>
  <li>IRR is quirky and gameable
  </li>
  <li>Lack of marketability & control are a trap
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Poor returns</h4>
I don't know any large+universal public data set. Secrecy is common (confidentiality agreements) and funds generally only publicize cherry-picked data.
The anecdotes and semi-public meta-analyses that do exist suggest no overperformance:
<ul>
  <li>Wall Street Journal - "What does Nevada's $35 Billion Fund Manager Do All Day? Nothing. Nevada goes passive to beat peers" -
    <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-does-nevadas-35-billion-fund-manager-do-all-day-nothing-1476887420">WSJ article</a> -
    <a href="data-files/2024/11/wsj-nevada-pension.pdf">local copy</a> -
    "The Nevada system’s stocks and bonds are all in low-cost funds that mimic indexes." - "From his one-story office building
in Carson City, Mr. Edmundson
commands funds whose returns
over one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year periods ending June 30 bested the nation’s
largest public pension, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers,
    and deeply-staffed plans of many other states."

  <li>New York Times - "Pension Advisors Learn the Folly of Trying to Beat the Market" - Aug 21, 2015 - 
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/your-money/pension-advisers-learn-the-folly-of-trying-to-beat-the-market.html">NYT article</a> -
    <a href="data-files/2024-11/nyt-nevada-pension.pdf">local copy</a> -
    "Earlier this year, the New York City comptroller issued a report concluding that
nearly all of the outperformance it achieved in investments like the ones that Nevada now indexes went into
the pockets of the outside managers who achieved them, in the form of fees."
  </li>
  
  <li>Warren Buffett's Hedge Fund Wager -
    <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2016ltr.pdf">description in 2016 Berkshire Letter</a>
    <blockquote>
In Berkshire’s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investment
management by professionals – in aggregate – would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved by
rank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of “helpers” would leave
their clients – again in aggregate – worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost index
fund. (See pages 114 - 115 for a reprint of the argument as I originally stated it in the 2005 report.)<br/><br/>

      Subsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at least
five hedge funds – wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles – that would over an extended period match
the performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet and
named a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade of
fund managers – who could include their own fund as one of the five – to come forth and defend their
occupation. After all, these managers urged others to bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting
a little of their own money on the line?<br/><br/>

      What followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managers
      who have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man – Ted Seides –
      stepped up to my challenge. Ted was a co-manager of Protégé Partners, an asset manager that had raised money
from limited partners to form a fund-of-funds – in other words, a fund that invests in multiple hedge funds.
<br/><br/>

      I hadn’t known Ted before our wager, but I like him and admire his willingness to put his money where
      his mouth was. He has been both straight-forward with me and meticulous in supplying all the data that both he
and I have needed to monitor the bet.
<br/><br/>
      For Protégé Partners’ side of our ten-year bet, Ted picked five funds-of-funds whose results were to be
      averaged and compared against my Vanguard S&P index fund. The five he selected had invested their money in
      more than 100 hedge funds, which meant that the overall performance of the funds-of-funds would not be
distorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.
<br/><br/>
      Each fund-of-funds, of course, operated with a layer of fees that sat above the fees charged by the hedge
      funds in which it had invested. In this doubling-up arrangement, the larger fees were levied by the underlying
      hedge funds; each of the fund-of-funds imposed an additional fee for its presumed skills in selecting hedge-fund
managers.
<br/><br/>
      Here are the results for the first nine years of the bet – figures leaving no doubt that Girls Inc. of Omaha,
      the charitable beneficiary I designated to get any bet winnings I earned, will be the organization eagerly opening
      the mail next January.

owners – if they all just stayed in their rocking chairs – is now going to a swelling army of Helpers.

portions of the winnings when they are smart or lucky, and leave family members with all of the losses –
and large fixed fees to boot – when the Helpers are dumb or unlucky (or occasionally crooked). "

    <blockquote>
      Larry was a student who came to Yale, very bright student, intending to go into the sciences. First year he had straight A’s or 90s — whatever grading system we were using then. End of his sophomore first semester, he’d failed all his courses. So I called him in to see what the reason was. And he said he just decided he wanted to read instead of going to all these science classes.<br/><br/>

So I asked him what he read, and he started listing the books he’d read. And so I sent him home, told him to come back the next day with an accurate list of every book that he’d read. And he came back with a rather extensive list. It was mostly in poetry and fiction. So I gave it to a couple of members of the English Department and I said, “If somebody had told you they’d read all these books, what would you say about them?” And both professors responded by saying, “This is a very well read, intelligent person.” So I consulted my colleagues and said, “Let’s give this guy credit for the semester but tell him from now on he’s got to do it the regular way.”<br/><br/>

      Well, Larry went on… He didn’t win the Nobel Prize, but he won a big prize in biology, a national prize for his work. And when he came back to Yale as a 55-60 year-old man, he was talking to Yale’s president and asked if Chauncey was still alive. And when told he was, the president asked me to come right over and see him. And Larry told me that that experience of being able to go off on his own for a semester and read all those books not only was terribly important to him, but he said he really felt it made him a better scientist. Because he had gotten out of science and into the humanities in a way that made him think about things that he might not have thought about before. I think that’s wonderful, because I think flexibility in how you structure an individual’s education is the best possible thing. If it has to be done by rules and regulations, you may miss out some on some good opportunities.

Aquinas -- Summa -- Part 2.1, Question 30, Article 4: Whether concupiscence is infinite? <br/>
<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/summa/2030.htm">primary source</a>
<blockquote>
  On the contrary, The Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3) that "since concupiscence is infinite, men desire an infinite number of things."<br/><br/>

  I answer that, As stated above (Article 3), concupiscence is twofold; one is natural, the other is not natural. Natural concupiscence cannot be actually infinite: because it is of that which nature requires; and nature ever tends to something finite and fixed. Hence man never desires infinite meat, or infinite drink. But just as in nature there is potential successive infinity, so can this kind of concupiscence be infinite successively; so that, for instance, after getting food, a man may desire food yet again; and so of anything else that nature requires: because these bodily goods, when obtained, do not last for ever, but fail. Hence Our Lord said to the woman of Samaria (John 4:13): "Whosever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again." <br/><br/>

  But non-natural concupiscence is altogether infinite. Because, as stated above (Article 3), it follows from the reason, and it belongs to the reason to proceed to infinity. Hence 
  he reason to proceed to infinity. Hence he that desires riches, may desire to be rich, not up to a certain limit, but to be simply as rich as possible.<br/><br/>

  Another reason may be assigned, according to the Philosopher (Polit. i, 3), why a certain concupiscence is finite, and another infinite. Because concupiscence of the end is always infinite: since the end is desired for its own sake, e.g. health: and thus greater health is more desired, and so on to infinity; just as, if a white thing of itself dilates the sight, that which is more white dilates yet more. On the other hand, concupiscence of the means is not infinite, because the concupiscence of the means is in suitable proportion to the end. Consequently those who place their end in riches have an infinite concupiscence of riches; whereas those who desire riches, on account of the necessities of life, desire a finite measure of riches, sufficient for the necessities of life, as the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3). The same applies to the concupiscence of any other things.

Aristotle, Politics Book 1 Part 9:

<blockquote>
  For natural riches and the natural art of wealth-getting are a different thing; in their true form they are part of the management of a household; whereas retail trade is the art of producing wealth, not in every way, but by exchange. And it is thought to be concerned with coin; for coin is the unit of exchange and the measure or limit of it. And there is no bound to the riches which spring from this art of wealth getting. <br/><br/>

  As in the art of medicine there is no limit to the pursuit of health, and as in the other arts there is no limit to the pursuit of their several ends, for they aim at accomplishing their ends to the uttermost (but of the means there is a limit, for the end is always the limit), so, too, in this art of wealth-getting there is no limit of the end, which is riches of the spurious kind, and the acquisition of wealth. But the art of wealth-getting which consists in household management, on the other hand, has a limit; the unlimited acquisition of wealth is not its business. And, therefore, in one point of view, all riches must have a limit; nevertheless, as a matter of fact, we find the opposite to be the case; for all getters of wealth increase their hoard of coin without limit. <br/><br/>

  The source of the confusion is the near connection between the two kinds of wealth-getting; in either, the instrument is the same, although the use is different, and so they pass into one another; for each is a use of the same property, but with a difference: accumulation is the end in the one case, but there is a further end in the other. Hence some persons are led to believe that getting wealth is the object of household management, and the whole idea of their lives is that they ought either to increase their money without limit, or at any rate not to lose it. The origin of this disposition in men is that they are intent upon living only, and not upon living well; and, as their desires are unlimited they also desire that the means of gratifying them should be without limit. <br/><br/>

  Those who do aim at a good life seek the means of obtaining bodily pleasures; and, since the enjoyment of these appears to depend on property, they are absorbed in getting wealth: and so there arises the second species of wealth-getting. For, as their enjoyment is in excess, they seek an art which produces the excess of enjoyment; and, if they are not able to supply their pleasures by the art of getting wealth, they try other arts, using in turn every faculty in a manner contrary to nature. The quality of courage, for example, is not intended to make wealth, but to inspire confidence; neither is this the aim of the general's or of the physician's art; but the one aims at victory and the other at health. Nevertheless, some men turn every quality or art into a means of getting wealth; this they conceive to be the end, and to the promotion of the end they think all things must contribute. <br/><br/>

Carlyle - Latter Day Pamphlets -
<blockquote>
My friends, across these fogs of murky twaddle and philanthropism, in spite of sad decadent 'world-trees,' with their rookeries of foul creatures, -- the silent stars, and all the eternal luminaries of the world, shine even now to him that has an eye. In this day as in all days, around and in every man, are voices from the gods, imperative to all, if obeyed by even none, which say audibly, "Arise, thou son of Adam, son of Time; make this thing more divine, and that thing, -- and thyself, of all things; and work, and sleep not; for the Night cometh, wherein no man can work!" He that has an ear may still hear.<br/><br/>

Surely, surely, this ignoble sluggishness, sceptical torpor, indifference to all that does not bear on Mammon and his interests is not the natural state of human creatures; and is not doomed to be their final one! Other states once were, or there had never been a Society, or any noble thing, among us at all. Under this brutal stagnancy there lies painfully imprisoned some tendency which could become heroic.<br/><br/>


The restless gnawing ennui which, like a dark dim ocean-flood, communicating with the Phlegethons and Stygian deeps, begirdles every human life so guided, -- is it not the painful cry even of that imprisoned heroism? Imprisoned it will never rest; set forth at present, on these sad terms, it cannot be. You unfortunates, what is the use of your money-bags, of your territories, funded properties, your mountains of possessions, equipments and mechanic inventions, which the flunky passes over, awestruck, and almost rises into epos and prophecy at sight of? No use, or less than none.  Your skin is covered, and your digestive and other bodily apparatus is supplied; and you have but to wish in these respects, and more is ready; and--the Devils, I think, are quizzing you. You ask for 'happiness,' "O give me happiness!" -- and they hand you ever new varieties of covering for the skin, ever new kinds of supply for the digestive apparatus, new and ever new, worse or not a whit better than the old; and -- and -- this is your 'happiness'? As if you were sick children; as if you were not men, but a kind of apes!<br/><br/>

I rather say, be thankful for your ennui; it is your last mark of manhood; this at least is a perpetual admonition, and true sermon preached to you. From the chair of verity this, whatever chairs be chairs of cantity. Happiness is *not* come, nor like to come; ennui, with its great waste ocean-voice, moans answer, Never, never. That ocean-voice, I tell you, is a great fact, it comes from Phlegethon and the gates of the Abyss; its bodeful never-resting inexorable moan is the voice of primeval Fate, and of the eternal necessity of things.  Will you shake away your nightmare and arise; or must you lie writhing under it, till death relieve you? Unfortunate creatures! You are fed, clothed, lodged as men never were before; every day in new variety of magnificence are you equipped and attended to; such wealth of material means as is now yours was never dreamed of by man before: -- and to do any noble thing, with all this mountain of implements, is forever denied you.  Only ignoble, expensive and unfruitful things can you now do; nobleness has vanished from the sphere where you live.  The way of it is lost, lost; the possibility of it has become incredible. We must try to do with it, I am told. -- Well; rejoice in your upholsteries and cookeries, then, if so be they will make you 'happy.' Let the varieties of them be continual and innumerable. In all things let perpetual change, if that is a perpetual blessing to you, be your portion instead of mine; incur that Prophet's curse, and in all things in this sublunary world 'make yourselves like unto a wheel.' Mount into your railways; whirl from place to place, at the rate of fifty, or if you like of five hundred miles an hour: you cannot escape from that inexorable all-encircling ocean-moan of ennui. No: if you would mount to the stars, and do yacht-voyages under the belts of Jupiter, or stalk deer on the ring of Saturn, it would still begirdle you. You cannot escape from it, you can but change your place in it, without solacement except one moment's. That prophetic Sermon from the Deeps will continue with you, till you wisely interpret it and do it, or else till the Crack of Doom shallow it and you. Adieu: Au revoir.

Kipling, speech at McGill university <br/>
<a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1908/3/24/kipling-on-wealth-pby-request-the/">Transcript in Harvard Crimson 1908</a> <br/>
<blockquote>
March 24, 1908
By request the CRIMSON publishes below a most interesting and instructive address, delivered recently by Rudyard Kipling before the students of McGill University. In an age when values are reckoned so absolutely in dollars and cents, the testimony of a man who has faced life from every possible side, and has found money a secondary aim, should demand more than passing notice.<br/><br/>

Following are Mr. Kipling's sentiments:<br/><br/>

"When, to use a detestable phrase, you go out into the battle of life you will be confronted by an organized conspiracy which will try to make you believe that the world is governed by the idea of wealth for wealth's sake, and that all means which lead to the acquisition of that wealth are, if not laudable, at least expedient. Those of you who have fitly imbibed the spirit of our university--and it was not a materialistic university which trained a scholar to take both the Graven and the Ireland in England--will violently resent that thought, but you will live and eat and move and have your being in a world dominated by that thought. Some of you will probably succumb to the poison of it.<br/><br/>

"Now I do not ask you not to be carried away by the first rush of the great game of life. That is expecting you to be more than human. But I do ask you, after the heat of the game, that you draw breath and watch your fellows for a while. Sooner or later you will see some man to whom the idea of wealth as mere wealth does not appeal, whom the methods of amassing that wealth do not interest, and who will not accept money if you offer it to him at a certain price.<br/><br/>

"At first you will be inclined to laugh at this man, and to think that he is not smart in his ideas. I suggest that you watch him closely, for he will presently demonstrate to you that money dominates everybody except the man who does not want money. You may meet that man on your farm, in your village, or in your Legislature. But be sure that, whenever or where ever you meet him, as soon as it comes to a direct issue between you, his little finger will be thicker than your loins. You will go in fear of him; he will not go in fear of you. You will do what he wants; he will not do what you want. You will find that you have no weapon in your armory with which you can attack him; no argument with which you can appeal to him. Whatever you gain, he will gain more.<br/><br/>

"I would like you to study that man. I would like you better to be that man, because from the lower point of view it doesn't pay to be obsessed by the desire of wealth for wealth's sake. If more wealth is necessary for you, for purposes not your own, use your left hand to acquire it, but keep your right for your proper work in life. If you employ both arms in that game you will be in danger of stooping; in danger of losing your soul. But in spite of every thing you may succeed, you may be successful, you may acquire enormous wealth. In which case I warn you that you stand in grave danger of being spoken and written of and pointed out as a smart man. And that is one of the most terrible calamities that can overtake a sane, civilized white man in our empire today.<br/><br/>

"They say youth is the season of hope, ambition, and uplift--that the last word youth needs is an exhortation to be cheerful. Some of you here know, and I remember; that youth can be a season of great depression, despondencies, doubts, and waverings, the worse because they seem to be peculiar to ourselves and incommunicable to our fellows. There is a certain darkness into which the soul of the young man some time descends--a horror of desolation, abandonment, and realized worthlessness, which is one of the most real of the hells in which we are compelled to walk.<br/><br/>

"I know of what I speak. This is due to a variety of causes, the chief of which is the egotism of the human animal itself. But I can tell you for your comfort that the chief cure for it is to interest yourself, to lose yourself, in some issue not personal to yourself--in another man's trouble or, preferably, another man's joy. But if the dark hour does not vanish, as sometimes it doesn't; if the black cloud will not lift, as sometimes it will not; let me tell you again for your comfort that there are many liars in the world, but there are no liars like your own sensations. The despair and the horror mean nothing, because there is for you nothing irremediable, nothing ineffaceable, nothing irrecoverable in anything you may have said or thought or done. If for any reason you cannot believe or have not been taught to believe in the infinite mercy of Heaven, which has made us all, and will take care we do not go far astray, at least believe that you are not yet sufficiently important to be taken too seriously by the powers above us or beneath us. In other words, take anything and everything seriously except yourselves.<br/><br/>

"I regret that I noticed certain signs of irreverent laughter when I alluded to the word 'smartness.' I have no message to deliver, but if I had a message to deliver to a university which I love, to the young men who have the future of their country to mold, I would say with all the force at my command: Do not be smart. If I were not a doctor of this university with a deep interest in its discipline, and if I did not hold the strongest views on that reprehensible form of amusement known as 'rushing,' I would say that whenever and-whenever you find one of your dear little playmates showing signs of smartness in his work, his talk, or his play, take him tenderly by the hand, by both hands, by the back of the neck if necessary, and lovingly, playfully, but firmly, lead him to a knowledge of higher and more interesting things."
