Directions:
1. Download company list from nasdaq: 
   http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/company-list.aspx
   download the three csv files linked there (amex, nyse, nasdaq)
2. Run v1.sh to reformat it, remove LPs & ETFs, remove sub-$1 stocks
   and remove mktcaps outside my limits.
3. Sort the output of v1 by mktcap col (4): sort -t, -k 4,4 -nr
4. Run v2.sh to get a text breakdown of industry representation.


Specific steps I followed:
a) To print text industry histogram: 
    ./v1.sh *.csv | ./v2.sh
b) To examine different modulo industry histograms:
    ./v1.sh *.csv | sort -t, -k 4,4 -nr |\
     awk -F, '{if (NR % 40 == 8) print}' | ./v2.sh
c) Print selections to a text file:
    (same as above, replacing v2 with redirect to file)
    (filename is selections.yyyymmdd)
d) Manually examine for exclusions like Trusts, etc.
   Then start to buy!
