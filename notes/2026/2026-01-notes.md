  > But what kind of information are you trying to learn from a fiction book?

### hiking / camping / backpacking

* __Hikin Jim's Blog__ -- best seasonal trail, fire, water details on San Gorgonio --

* __Cal Topo with San Gorgonio details__ -- good map -- not sure how I found it --
  [link][cal-gorgonio]

* __Wandering Daisy__ on Bomber Canyon in northern Wind River --

* __Wind River__ -- good photo/report on Golden Lakes from Hay Pass --
  [link][golden-timico]

* __Cold Springs Trailhead__ on SummitPost --
  [link][cold-spring-winds] -- includes crazy comments like
  > The only way to access the trailhead is to contract with an Indian guide to have them drive
  >  you to and from the trailhead. Contact Ramona O'Neal (Mone) at 307-486-2318 for
  >  transportation. She lives right next door to the Crowheart Store / gas station. The driveway
  > to her home is 20 feet north of the store.
  > 
  > The standard meeting time is 8am at Mone's house, and 11am at the Cold Springs trailhead
  > for the return ride. The ride to/from the trailhead is about 1.5 hours over a rough 4WD dirt
  >  road. You leave your car at Mone's house. Cost for the transportation seems to vary,
  >  depending perhaps on whether or not there are any other pick-ups / drop-offs combined with
  >  yours. When I first called Mone, she quoted a cost of $600 round trip for 2 people. When I
  > called back to reserve a date and told her there were 3 of us, the price was still $600 total.
  > Then when I arrived and there were only 2 of us, the price dropped to $500. (I didn't question
  > the discount.)

### politics

* __whatifalist__ on socialism -- [nitter post][whatif-socialism]
  > One of the horrifying things I realized was Socialism was basically voting public’s begging to
  > have serfdom again. This was something that was widely said during the early USSR, which
  > was called “the second serfdom” by Russian peasants. In both there’s no private property,
  > everything is collective and under total ownership by a repressive state. Russia was unusually
  > bad as serfdom went, with High Medieval Western Europe being way better than either.
  >
  > What the Socialist says when he wants no struggle, no property, no competition and no choice
  > is “I crave a life of slavery that doesn’t require I think or take responsibility for my choices at all”.
  > That’s why Communism always devolves into the state forcing you to work with terrible
  > conditions, which is de facto identical to slavery. The fact he's not mature  enough to realize
  > he's doing this should more than prove my point.
  >
  > The feudal lord is way nicer by and large than the Socialist state. My historic speciality is the
  > Middle Ages. You don’t want to fight me on this. The feudal lord gets to be rich and powerful
  > while the Socialist state is impersonal. That’s the core of it. They would rather live in slavery
  > than live better and know someone else is better than them
