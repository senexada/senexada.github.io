Subject: In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Products Liability Litigation, Case No. 1:08-WP-65000 (MDL 2001)
</pre>

<p>I thank the court for the opportunity to comment.</p>

<p>If the Settlement's Exhibit A is accurate, that the plaintiffs have spent the last nine years of their lives reading one million pages about moldy washing machines, I pity the attorneys who would forfeit so much self respect in pursuit of filthy lucre, and I pity the judges that grant them succor for reasons unfathomable to an ordinary man.</p>

<p>You allow me to comment, but you withhold the number of defective products, the mean cost of mitigation, the probable number of claimants -- i.e. the information essential to evaluate the fairness of the settlement. You should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>

<p>Attorneys I have never met are exploiting my situation to obtain over $14 million to themselves.  That they fail to represent my interests is evident by the paucity of the award: an insignificant rebate on a product I had no intention of purchasing.  They offer me nothing of value, yet keep millions of dollars of cash for themselves.</p>

<p>If the court believes the rebate to be fair and genuine compensation, I propose that the attorney fees be paid entirely in 5% rebates on Sears merchandise, with two pages of paperwork per item purchased.   I do not jest.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander, as the old saying goes.</p>

<p>The claim form presents the further absurdity of requiring a serial number for a product I purchased over a decade ago, located in a city over 500 miles distant from my current domicile.  If the injured parties cannot easily obtain even their pittance of redress, where is justice?  Why is the court allowing this absurdity?  Are the class action courts so corrupt that redress to the victims no longer matters?</p>

<p>Exclude me from the settlement.  And please sincerely ask yourselves tonight why you have wasted so many healthy, vigorous years of your life arguing about moldy washing machines.</p>
