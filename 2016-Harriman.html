<p class="regtext">This trip was an overnight trip to the William Brien shelter in Harriman.
Prior overnights in Harriman include the Stockbridge shelter (Dad + N), Bald Rocks (Dad + N + friends),
and Tom Jones (Dad + H).  Older photos aren't online yet.</p>

<p class="regtext">We left home at 9:45am Saturday and started hiking from Silvermine Lake at 10:55am.

</p>
<p class="regtext">
  Note the two cleared paths up the hill behind H: these aren't shown on the map, but the left one may
  connect to a mapped woods road that continues ssw from the summit.  This route might constitute
  a drier alternative to the damp, stream-crossed yellow path along the lake.  Most of the damp spots had
  kid-friendly stepping stones, but there were 2-3 "swamps" that required child carry.

</p>

<p class="regtext">Silvermine Lake is more than half mile long and was deserted this overcast morning.

</p>

<p class="regtext">After passing the lake, the trail follows its main inlet stream (Bockey Swamp Brook)
  uphill, eventually crossing to its eastern side.  The trail is wide with an easy grade.  You can hear
  the brook as you ascend.  We stopped along this section for grilled cheese.

</p>

<p class="regtext">We reached the William Brien shelter at 12:30pm.  There were at least six flat spots in the
  vicinity, most with fire rings. We chose our favorite and pitched our tent.

  <div class="photo"><img src="camp-images/2016-harriman/IMG_3329.jpg"><p class="caption">A break from the afternoon mist</p></div>
</p>

<p class="regtext">The shelter is directly on the Appalachian Trail.  We met two solo through hikers heading
  to Maine, one who was so elderly it was impressive.
  We also met two day hikers who explored the area and showed H a bright orange Salamander.
</p>

<p class="regtext">Starting around 3:30pm we tried for an hour to light a fire, but the wood was too damp from
  a week of rain.  Neither the candle, the wax/sawdust plug, nor a book of matches worked.
  The thinnest twigs would smoulder but refuse to burn. Reminder for eastern camping: bring lots of inflammable
  liquids for cooking!  Our hotdogs had to settle for a lukewarm heating over a candle. I wish I had taken
  a photo.  I didn't even attempt heating the baked beans.
</p>

<p class="regtext">After dinner we climbed a few hills in the vicinity and retired to the tent.
  The evening activities were coloring and Spot It.  Dad got tired at 7:30pm but of course
  Olivia was not at all sleepy.

<p class="regtext">She said the face hole in her sleeping bag was a defect and that a sleeping bag should have no hole.
   She also insisted that the proper way to enter a sleeping bag was head first.
  <div class="photo"><img src="camp-images/2016-harriman/IMG_3332.jpg"><p class="caption">Proof of the head-first sleeping bag technique</p></div>
</p>

<p class="regtext">Dad fell asleep first. The night was quiet and dry until around 4:00am, when it
   began to rain steadily.
   It was raining hard when H awoke at 7:30am.  We ate breakfast under the tarp while it poured.

  <div class="photo"><img src="camp-images/2016-harriman/IMG_3333.jpg"><p class="caption">Dried mango in the pouring rain</p></div>
</p>

<p class="regtext">We poked around until 9:30am, when the rain abruptly stopped and the sun appeared.
  It felt wonderful.  We packed and hit the trail.  It was an hour and fifteen minutes to the car, which
  is faster than the ascent, partly because it's downhill, partly because H was highly motivated to beat the
  duck that was swimming north in the lake (we did beat it) (sorry, no photos of the duck).
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  It has rained on every overnight I've had in Harriman, but this trip ended with bright sunshine on a 
  perfect spring day.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  Things to remember for future trips:
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li> Always bring marshmellows!</li>
    <li> Pack kleenex, paper towel, and a rag for cleaning kid hands</li>
    <li> Pack a huge fire kit in the east</li>
    <li> On rainy weeks bring a cooking stove; a campfire may be impossible</li>
  </ul>
