<h2>Reading List</h2>

<ul>
 <li>General Patton: A Soldier's Life -- Hirshson -- <i>The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.</i></li>

 <li>Patton: War as I knew it -- Patton -- <i>In case of doubt, attack.</i></li>

 <li> Good <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D1">online Livy</a> -- <i>Starting from the second beginnings of the city which, like a plant cut down to its roots, sprang up in greater beauty and fruitfulness, the details of its history both civil and military will now be exhibited in their proper order, with greater clearness and certainty.</i> </li>
