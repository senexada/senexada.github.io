<h2> Camping Research </h2>

<p class="regtext">
Consider the USGS "heat-map" of distance to the nearest road (official pdf <a href="https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/products/publications/21426/21426.pdf">available here</a>):

By eye, the biggest, darkest green spots are:
<ul class="regtext">
 <li> Yellowstone Complex (northwest WY) -- the largest blob (1.8M acres) comprises SE Yellowstone plus the Teton and Washakie Wildernesses. The nearly-contiguous area includes Grand Teton Park and the North Absaroka, Absaroka-Beartooth, and Jedediah Smith Wildernesses.</li>

 <li> Bob Marshall Complex (northwest MT) -- the huge blob (1.5M acres) comprises the Great Bear, Bob Marshall, and Scapegoat wildernesses.  Just north is Glacier Park (1M acres), which is largely roadless apart from two east-west roads.

</li>

 <li> Frank Church & Selway Bitterroot (ID) -- the largest blob comprises the Frank Church and Gospel Hump Wildernesses, which officially cover ~2.5M acres, but are surrounded by another 800k acres of roadless sections of National Forest .  The northen blob is the 1.3M acre Selway Bitterroot wilderness, separated from the Frank Church by a one-lane dirt road called the Magruder corridor.

 <li> The Sierra Crest (CA) -- this long and skinny wilderness comprises 14 individually named sections covering a 2.5M acre southern region and 600k acre north region, which are separated by a single road in Yosemite (Tioga road) that is open from May through October.</li>

 <li> Olympic Park (WA) -- most of the 900k acre park is wilderness.</li>

</ul> 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The next two biggest spots are in Utah and Nevada and are not suitable for camping.  The large blobs are military facilities (Wendover, Dugway, and Desert Test Center in UT; Nellis and nearby ranges in NV), and the nearby UT areas are salt desert or salt lake.  And while we're on the topic of unsuitable camp spots, the archipelago of green in southern CA comprises military ranges and some undesignated desert, and the one in southern AZ comprises military range, Indian reservation, and some desert wildlife refuges.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Continuing to eyeball the large spots or areas, we have:
<ul class="regtext">
 <li> Wind River Range (west-central WY) -- the Bridger, Fitzpatrick, and Popo Agie Wildernesses total about 700k acres.  The area is known for 14k mountains and 4000+ lakes.</li>
 
 <li> Northern Cascades (north central WA) -- in total there is about 2.3M acres of wilderness carved up by a few access roads (hence the lack of a huge dark green blob).  The biggest named areas are the Pasayten (500k), Glacier Peak (500k), and much of Northern Cascade Park (the park is 500k, but is not entirely wilderness).

</li>

 <li> Uinta Wilderness (northeast UT) -- a 500k acre wilderness in the only major east-west mountain range in the contiguous US.  The volcanic rock is poor for climbing, which somewhat reduces recreational usage.

</li>

 <li> Gila Wilderness (NM) -- a 600k acre wilderness in the Elk Mountains.  I don't know this area.</li>

 <li> Glen Canyon area (UT) -- appears to be part of Glen Canyon Rec Area, Grand Staircase Escalante Monument, and the Navajo reservation.</li>

 <li> Southwest Colorado -- the Weminuche (way-min-ook-ee) wilderness is 500k acres. It is very high: the average elevation is over 10k feet; low point 8k.</li>

 <li> Baxter area (ME) -- the roadless area around Baxter State Park is approx 200k acres (?), but it appears comparable in size to the CO & NM area.  Not sure why; online info is sparse. File this away for an east coast trip</li>

 <li> Florida and Louisiana Swamps -- not interested in camping there</li>

 <li> Boundary Waters (MN) -- canoeing destination. Reportedly horrendous mosquitoes.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Acreages are approximate, and when listed indicate officially designated wilderness.  Roadless areas can be larger than the wilderness boundary if adjacent lands happen to have no roads.
