### Pool / CYA / Chlorine / SWG Salt Water Generators

* [TFP on CYA][tfp-cya] - below 30 is major problem; summer UV index is 6-10x winter;
  CYA itself can degrade slowly (a few ppm per month)
* TFP mentioned product [Polyquat 60][polyquat] for stubborn algae
* [Best SWG][swg1] thread - mentions Circupool & Pentair IntelliChlor
* [Best Salt Chlorine Generator][swg2] thread
* Long, technical thread on [Degradation of Cyanuric Acid (CYA)][cya-tech] --
  seems like CYA can drop 3-10ppm per month, as a complex function of pH,
  Free Chlorine, temperature, etc.

* Example IntelliChlor [Installation Guide][intelli-guide]
* Example "dumb" [digital timer relay][nsi-timer] for 220V

### Misc articles

* [Antiqua et Nova][antiqua] -- papal encyclical on AI & tech

  * (29) A proper understanding of human intelligence, therefore, cannot be reduced
    to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead,
    it involves the person’s openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects
    an orientation toward the True and the Good. [...]
    From this, it follows that human intelligence possesses an essential contemplative
    dimension, an unselfish openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful,
    beyond any utilitarian purpose.
    
  * (34) Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks
    succumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work
    they can perform. However, a person’s worth does not depend on possessing specific
    skills, cognitive and technological achievements, or individual success, but on
    the person’s inherent dignity, grounded in being created in the image of God.
    This dignity remains intact in all circumstances, including for those unable
    to exercise their abilities, whether it be an unborn child, an unconscious person,
    or an older person who is suffering.

### OpenSSL stuff

Years ago I encrypted some files with openssl des3:
`openssl des3 -i foo -o foo.des3`

Trying to decrypt in 2025 on a macbook, it failed with _bad decrypt_, even when
I had the right password.

It took an hour or so with AI to figure this out.

* it suggested various options to openssl, like `-legacy` or `-provider legacy` --> these all failed
* it suggested I `brew install openssl@1.1` --> macbook failed to install: "not supported"
* it suggested running in docker --> this actually worked. Steps below.

#### The docker steps that actually worked:

* download docker from `docker.com`
* install docker
* create a docker instance:
    * `mkdir tmp; cd tmp`
    * (copy files into tmp)
    * `docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/data ubuntu:20.04 bash`
    * install openssl 1.1: `apt update && apt install -y openssl`
    * confirm it is 1.1.1f: `cd /data; openssl version`
    * actually decrypt using md5: `openssl des3 -d -in foo.des3 -out foo -md md5`
    * (it took a while to figure out the md5 thing; without it you still get _bad decrypt_)
    * (useful trick from ai: use `-out /dev/null` to isolate password handling from decryption;
       if _bad decrypt_ when using _/dev/null_, then password is wrong, file is corrupted, or
       there was an additional _-salt_ flag or custom digest. AI suggested that custom digest
       might have been md5 back then. I tried it and it worked)
