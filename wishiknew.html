<h2>Things I wish I knew</h2>

About:
<ul>
  <li>Resumes -- many jobs of 2 years or less is a bad sign; it takes large companies about two years to fire
      a terrible performer</li>
  <li>Interviews -- the person should be able to describe measureable accomplishments, not just actions.
      Having hobbies is a good litmus test for curiousity/energy.</li>
  <li>Investment taxation -- the richest people do not pay taxes. The legal way to not pay taxes is to
      not realize gains.  The more complex the investment, often the worse the taxes.</li>
</ul>
