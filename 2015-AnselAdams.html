<p class="regtext"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter the prior year's rigor and drenching in Wyoming,
we returned to Cali for a drier, gentler trip.  It was indeed bone dry but its gentleness depends on
your perspective (more on that later).  It also offered a backcountry surprise, something I never expected to stumble upon
in the wilderness.

<p class="regtext">Mammoth Lakes is a beautiful mountain town high in the 
Sierra wilderness, yet trailhead access is tedious.
In summertime, the San Joaquin trailheads are only accessible via
a slow shuttle bus from the gondola. We parked near the gondola about 10am,
boarded a shuttle at 10:40, reached the Devil's Postpile stop (7560') at 11:15, and
hit the John Muir Trail (JMT) at 11:30.
</p>

<p class="regtext">The first mile reminded us that we were indeed back
in California: saturating sunshine, rare shade, cloudless but hazy-from-wildfire skies,
 and the finest of fine Sierra trail dust.</p>

<p class="regtext">We reached the Superior Lake trail in 45 minutes
and began the steady, moderate, and delightfully shady climb westward.
We reached Beck's cabin (9100') three hours later, which included a 
45 minute lunch stop.  From Beck's cabin it took half hour to the foot
of Superior Lake (notably: the first usable water since the trailhead)
and another hour to our destination, the north shore of Beck Lake.

<p class="regtext">It is a beautiful spot, isn't it?  But the photo doesn't
capture the chill.  At sunset it was a comfortable-sounding 50 degrees, but steady
winds above 20mph sucked away all our heat.  Roger was shivering, possibly due
to preexisting weariness from his half-ironman.  Steve had already used
six pair of socks and was hurting, a bad omen for the morrow.</p>

<p class="regtext">Our classic first night meal was perfectly proportioned this time:
6 steaks, 2 bricks of spinach, 1 loaf of polenta, and 4 key lime pies (for six people).
There were dissenting opinions on bringing N-1 steaks on future trips.
The pan fry worked well, but grease cleanup was ugly. We need to stick with
fire-permitted first night locations, which excludes most of Cali.</p>

<p class="regtext">The sun set at 6:15pm and the Milky Way's structure was visible
by 8:35.  We slept early to escape the howling wind. </p>
