<li> Buffett (<a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2016ltr.pdf">2016 Shareholder letter</a>): 
    My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index
   fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.<br/><br/>
  
  The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling,
entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy them
something superior compared to what the masses receive.<br/><br/>
In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason,
the financial “elites” – wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like – have great trouble
meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few
thousand dollars. This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is –on an
expectancy basis – clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elite
for superior investment advice has caused it, in aggregate, to waste more than $100 billion over the past decade.
Figure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money in
hedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall is
conservative
</li>
<li> Buffet:
Subsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at least
five hedge funds – wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles – that would over an extended period match
the performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees. I suggested a ten-year bet and
named a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade of
fund managers – who could include their own fund as one of the five – to come forth and defend their
occupation. After all, these managers urged others to bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting
a little of their own money on the line?<br/><br/>
What followed was the sound of silence. Though there are thousands of professional investment managers
who have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man – Ted Seides –
stepped up to my challenge.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li> Bogle: Simplicity is the master key to financial success</li>
<li> Kahneman: All of us would be better investors if we just made fewer decisions</li>
<li> Thoreau: Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify.</li>
<li> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away</li>
