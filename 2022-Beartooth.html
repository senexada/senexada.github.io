  <span class="dropcap">T</span>wice in this series we have exited the
  backcountry early: once for wildfire smoke, once for a confluence
  of heavy winds and route challenge.  This year was our third early exit,
  for a new reason to be revealed to the perservering reader. As usual,
  you may click images for a high-res version.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day One</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Bozeman was our launch point into the 944,000-acre Absaroka Beartooth
  Wilderness, which lies along the north border of Yellowstone. 
  We departed the downtown Kimpton (brand new) on Saturday morning Aug 6
  after a superb avocado toast on site.  Driving by 7:40am, we took I-90
  east to Livingston, exited onto Swingley Rd, and lost cell service by
  08:25.  We hit the National Forest boundary at 09:00, heading into the
  valley amid an unsettled forecast and clouds that threatened rain.
</p>

<p class="caption">Southbound on Boulder Creek Rd, with rain threatening</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
  Road quality was excellent, and the road had been repaired from a major recent washout,
  presumably due to the many large permanent camps along this stretch.
  It degraded only for the last handful of miles, during which we 
  averaged 8-10 mph, reaching Upsidedown Trailhead (our exit point) at 09:58 and
  Box Canyon Trailhead (our starting point) at 10:10.  A few spots felt
  sketchy in our SUVs, so we were humbled to see six horse trailers and a Corolla
  were among the ten vehicles at the trailhead. 
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    It was about 50F and verging on rain as we packed.
    We got the group shot at a fine bridge right at the parking lot.
</p>

<p class="caption">The Start</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    The trail up East Fork Boulder Creek began wide and gentle, quickly entering the tall pines.
</p>

<p class="caption">An easy stroll into the clouds on East Fork Boulder Creek</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    The rain started about noon and continued most of the day and night, so the photo
    above is all you get today.  The handful of unforested sections had nothing to see due to
    the rain and mist. But the trail was gentle, the creeks were
    well-bridged, and the forest was glistening, so it was a pleasant hike nonetheless.
</p>

<p class="caption">Ok, I lied, I found one more unspectactular photo before the rain</p></div>
  
<p class="regtext">
  We couldn't see much in the mist, but we passed a few erratic boulder fields interrupting the forest,
  and saw the small lake after the Rainbow Creek junction, which was pretty and had a campsite.
</p>

<p class="regtext">  
    We continued up Rainbow Creek to a decent campsite (or so it seemed in the mist) at about 8800'.
    We managed with great effort to burn the drenched wood in a meager fire, just enough to
    cook the steaks.  Despite several heavy bouts of rain, which soaked every sock I
    was carrying,
    everyone was satisfied with the day: good trail, good distance, good elevation,
    reasonable temperatures, and few mosquitos.  There wasn't much lounging after dinner, as the rain continued
    most of the night.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  At 8:30 the glorious sun reached our camp.  I spent a couple hours drying my entire wardrobe,
  and others did similarly. We broke camp at 11am and by noon I felt hot and dry, a short six
  hours after feeling that everything I owned would be damp the entire trip.  We declared
  a "0%" chance of rain for the rest of the trip.

  <p class="regtext">
    We passed a handful of groups today after seeing only two people in yesterday's rain.
    Ascending toward Lake Plateau, we encountered the first meaningful meadows and open vistas.
</p>

<p class="caption">Up Trail 28, approaching Lake Plateau</p></div>
  
  <p class="regtext">
    At Wounded Man Lake we passed two fisherman. Continuing along its north shore on
    trail 93, there was deadfall across the trail and accordingly no sign of recent
    stock usage.  We took a break at the foot of Lake Pinchot before moving onward toward
    our target of Ravin (or maybe Cimmerian) Lake.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-b2NZWth/0/4K/i-b2NZWth-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">North shore of Woulded Man or Pinchot (not sure which) from Trail 91</p></div>
  
  <p class="regtext">
    The trail after Pinchot became narrow & overgrown as it steeply descended the
    forested ravine. Dreary Lake is aptly named and had no decent campsites, due to sloped forest or
    marshy ground everywhere we scouted.
  </p>

  <p class="regtext">
    After Dreary, we lost the trail as it braided through a few small
    meadows. Ultimately we found it again at a bridge across the stream near Lake Ravin.
    Ravin was beautiful, but
    we scouted all the way to
    Ravin foot without finding a large enough campsite.  We considered scouting onward to Lake
    Surrender, but ultimately surrendered even sooner and worked our way back upstream toward
    Pinchot. There was a decent site north of the trail
    on the west end of Ravin, but the views weren't as good as the foot of Pinchot, so we
    continued to retrace our steps upstream.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    Around 5:30 we reached the beautiful meadow at the foot of Lake Pinchot, having traveled
    9.5 miles today (27k steps according to my watch).

  <p class="regtext">
    We ate Ramen and S'mores and began to battle the mosquitos, which will figure prominently
    over the next two days.  The headnets were well worth their 1oz weight.  Any exposed
    skin, or skin beneath a single layer, was attacked.  As it cooled enough to don multi-layer mosquito
    protection we watched twilight over the lake.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  The stationary day debates began: who would day hike and where? Who would begin
  agitating for Vegas?  What year will standard cell phones have satellite texting?
  How much total solar radiation energy (all frequencies) would be collected right
  here this morning (8am) vs solar noon (~1pm) by a collector
  normal to the sun's rays?
</p>

    <p class="regtext">
      For the last question, after Jeff made an outrageous claim, the subsequent guesses
      recorded in the backcountry were:
      <table class="narrowtable">

    <p class="regtext">
      On the topic of day hike, despise the clouds of mosquitos, the only takers for a stroll
      above treeline (mosquito free?) were Bill and me -- oh Jason, where art though?
      We targeted the unnamed
      mountain south of Lake Pinchot and west of Clam Lake. Heading southbound along the west
      shore of Dreary Lake required a significant traverse through a talus field.

	  I spotted Trouble Lake on our ascent but didn't capture a good photo.  There
	  were some interesting rock slabs near its outlet.  I never caught a good look
	  at Clam Lake, due to the topography and forest.
	</p>

	<p class="regtext">	
	  We reached the unmarked summit after about two hours of hiking. 
	  Despite the rocky terrain and high winds, there were... mosquitos.

<p class="caption">Looking west to Lake Plateau from near the summit</p></div>

    <p class="regtext">
      Due to the flat mountain top, we had to move slightly downhill and north to
      see Lake Pinchot. Our campsite is not quite visible, even on the high res
      version, due to iphone lens limitation.  Diaphonous Lake and the tiny unnamed lake
      above Pinchot looked attactive, as did the nice hikeable-looking ramp from there to Chalice Peak.

      <p class="regtext">
	This was a solid day trip: good views, good distance, good challenge.  We basically retraced our
	route on the descent.  At one point of the talus slope we diverged and found ourself
	among car-sized to house-sized boulders, which made for slow and fatiguing down-climbing.

    We found the stationary folks to be stationary and bemoaning the mosquitos.
    It was difficult to swim without numerous bites.

  <p class="regtext">
    The backcountry pizza collaboration was great, as usual, with half of them
    cooked with our masterly wood-fired grilled pizza technique.  This dinner is a true

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Four</b></p>
    
  <p class="regtext">
    Today's plan was to travel about halfway back toward the cars, crossing Lake Plateau and
    camping at Horseshoe Lake.  I had learned my lesson from prior hikes and placed us
    16 miles from the road to dissuade the annual agitation for early exit. (If we had camped
    at Ravin Lake it would have been 17+. But even from Pinchot, I figured 16 would be adequate).
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    I underestimated the attractive & repulsive forces: the attraction of post-hike Vegas
    (for the usual suspects) and the repulsion of the swarms of mosquitos. Early-exit agitation
    began.
    Even so, 16 miles would dissuade the agitators, right? Especially with our late start at 1040am.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    Leaving Pinchot, where we had seen no one for two days, we encountered over a dozen people
    on Lake Plateau, several at each lake or trail segment. One fisherman told us the
    lakes freeze to the bottom in winter, and that the fish are air dropped
    by helicopter (is that believable?).  The plateau itself is gentle and framed by
    distant mountains.
</p>

    <p class="regtext">
      The Rainbow Lakes were pretty and had plenty of flat, open ground for camping.

    <p class="regtext">
      About 1pm we reached the junction with Upsidedown Creek Trail (junction of 28 & 26)
      and began the great debate: follow the plan (camp at Horseshoe Lake), pivot to an early exit
      down Rainbow Creek (retracing our entry), or hike to Horseshoe Lake, eat lunch, and re-evaluate.
      After some dubious advice from a bypasser, and a dubious vote-counting exercise, we
      chose the third option.
</p>

  <div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-sPsMLWf/0/4K/i-sPsMLWf-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">Small saddle above Horseshoe Lake</p></div>
    
    <p class="regtext">
      Horseshoe Lake was... pretty good. Absent mosquitos & Vegas, the original plan may have
      prevailed.  But as the debate circled without progress, and the clock approached
      4pm, Padraig's ten simultaneous bites put him over the edge, and he made a unilateral
      departure toward the cars. 
</p>

  <div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-mF6DPMV/0/4K/i-mF6DPMV-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">Horseshoe Lake</p></div>

    <p class="regtext">
      I disliked the situation. I was unsure if everyone was up for a 16 mile day, with a
      potentially joint-jarring 3000'+ of descent from Horseshoe to the road.  And now we
      were separated into several groups without a plan.
</p>

    <p class="regtext">
      The physical exertion proved not too bad: the trail was good and the switchbacks were gentle.
      There wasn't much water and my bottles ran dry with five miles to go.  I perhaps had 
      a salt imbalance, because I had clear urine but insatiable thirst, which was cured when Bill
      fed me salt. Several rockslides made this route more pleasant
      by opening views of the healthy forest and by making the trail impassable to stock.
</p>

<p class="caption">Looking back up-valley from a rockslide area</p></div>
    
    <p class="regtext">
      And that's about it. We completed the early exit on day 4 by covering the last 7 miles in
      about 3.5 hours, bringing the day's total
      to 16.5 miles. We were driving, with various levels of energy and mood, at dusk.

<p class="regtext"><b>Retrospective</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Scenery was good on the middle days. There was decent foot traffic on Lake Plateau, but we had solitude
  beyond Wounded Man Lake. Hiking a day in the rain
  had its upsides: fewer bugs and fewer people. Ultimately mosquitos and Vegas colluded for an early
  exit, despite the stationary site being 16 miles from the road. I guess I need to plan an
  even longer route next year.
