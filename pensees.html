<blockquote>
Anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself.
[36][164] 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Man, then, is so happily constituted that he has no exact principle of truth,
and several excellent ones of falsehood.
[44][82] 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
We never keep to the present. We recall the past; we anticipate the future as if 
we found it too slow in coming and were trying to hurry it up, or we recall the
past as if to stay its too rapid flight. We are so unwise that we wander about in
times that do not belongto us, and do not think of the only one that does;
so vain that we dream of times that are not and blindly flee the only one that is. The fact
is that the present usually hurts. We thrust it out of sight because it distresses us, 
and if we find it enjoyable, we are sorry to see it slip away. We try to give it the
support of the future, and think how we are going to arrange things over which
we have no control for a time we can never be sure of reaching.
[47][172]

<blockquote>
When I consider the brief span of my life absorbed into the eternity which comes before
and after -- as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day -- the small space
I occupy and which I see swallowed up in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I
know nothing and which know nothing of me, I take fright and am amazed to see myself 
here rather than there, now rather than then. Who put me here? By whose command and act
were this time and place allotted to me?
[68][205]

<blockquote>
Knowledge has two extremes which meet; one is the pure natural ignorance of every man
at birth, the other is the extreme reached by great minds who run through the whole
range of human knowledge, only to find that they know nothing and come back to the same
ignorance from which they set out, but it is a wise ignorance which knows itself.
Those who stand half-way have put their natural ignorance behind them without yet
attaining the other; they have some smattering of adequate knowledge and pretend
to understand everything. They upset the world and get everything wrong.
[83][327]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Epictetus goes much further when he asks: Why do we not lose our temper if someone
tells us that we have a headache, while we do lose it if someone says there is 
anything wrong with our arguments or our choice?

The reason for that is that we are quite certain that we have not got a headache,
and are not limping, but we are not so sure we are making the right choice.
Consequently, since the only thing that makes us sure is the evidence available
to us, we hestitate and are taken aback when the evidence available to someone
else makes him see just the opposite.
[98,99][80,536]

<blockquote>
Man's greatness comes from knowing he is wretched: a tree does not know it is wretched.
<br/><br/>
Thus it is wretched to know that one is wretched, but there is greatness in knowing one 
is wretched.
[114][397]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What then is man to do in this state of affairs? Is he to doubt everything, to doubt
whether he is awake, whether he is being pinched or burned? Is he to doubt whether he
is doubting, to doubt whether he exists?
<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>
What sort of freak then is man! How novel, how monstrous, how chaotic, how paradoxical,
how prodigious! Judge of all things, feeble earthworm, repository of truth, sink of
doubt and error, glory and refuse of the universe!
<br/><br/>
Who will unravel such a tangle? This is certainly beyond dogmatism and scepticism, beyond
all human philosophy. Let us then concede to the sceptics what they have so often
proclaimed, that truth lies beyond our scope and is an unattainable quarry, that it is no
earthly denizen, but at home in heaven, lying in the lap of God, to be known only in so far
as it pleases him to reveal it. Let us learn our true nature from the uncreated and
incarnate truth.
[131][434]

<blockquote>
Without doubt nothing is more shocking to our reason than to say that the sin of the
first man has implicated in its guilt men so far from the original sin that they seem incapable
of sharing it.  This flow of guilt does not seem merely impossible to us, but indeed
most unjust. What could be more contrary to the rules of our miserable justice than the eternal
damnation of a child, incapable of will, for an act in which he seems to have so little
part that it was actually committed 6,000 years before he existed?  Certainly nothing jolts
us more rudely than this doctrine, and yet, but for this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all,
we remain incomprehensible to ourselves.
[131][434]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I have often said that the sole cause of man's unhappiness is that he does not know how to
stay quietly in his room.
<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>
All our life passes in this way: we seek rest by struggling against certain obstacles, and
once they are overcome, rest proves intolerable because of the boredom it produces.
<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>
This is why this man, who lost his only son a few months ago and was so troubled and oppressed
this morning by lawsuits and quarrels, is not thinking about it any more. Do not be surprised;
he is concentrating all his attention on which way the boar will go that his dogs have been so
hotly pursuing for the past six hours. That is all he needs. However sad a man may be, if you
can persuade him to take up some diversion he will be happy while it lasts.
[136][139]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man 
a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries
in vain to fill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot
find in those that are, though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only
with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself.
[148][428]
