  <span class="dropcap">W</span>e beat the heat this year with daytime

<p class="regtext"><b>The Arrival</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Pinedale, Wyoming was our staging area and it exceeded all
  expectations. 
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2023/2023-Wind-River/i-nbGzbV7/0/NFD357JPdK9K53JTJdkCD6RGZP5rgcvDtzLD3gxLP/X2/IMG_5241-X2.jpg">

<p class="caption">Pinedale: "All the civilization you need"</p></div>

  
<p class="regtext">
  Pinedale's population of 2,005 is lower than its altitude (even when expressed in meters).
  And yet it had a solid brew pub, a great breakfast spot, and perhaps the best gear store
  we have ever encountered: truly all the civilization we needed.
</p>


  <p class="regtext">
    John described The Great Outdoor Shop "like going back in time." Suhas called it "the
    best shopping experience I've had in a long time."  Roger noted that they managed to upsell
    Jeff, John, and Steve.  And we all expressed surprise that fraud control didn't decline John's
    multiple transactions that I think reached 4 digits.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    We debated bear spray, with Roger noting that in 12 years, we have sprayed zero bears and
    three people.  Yet they managed to sell us the bear spray too after the employees affirmed
    that it's always good to have a Captain Safety Pants. (After most of us left the
    store, they asked Bill how we managed to bear spray more people than bears). Bear spray, chairs, fishing
    rod, maps -- it was incredible.  John even bought a mosquito dome and an electronic copy of "Fishing for Dummies" -- keep
    reading for the outcome.  And for some future year they told us about Wind River Pack
    Goat Adventures (Erik Bailly), which rents pack goats that follow you up the trail carrying
    40 pounds of gear each.  That store was a true highlight of the trip.
  </p>

<p class="regtext"><b>Day One</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Saturday, Aug 5 -- by 7am, Pinedale Airport was around 41 degrees; Steve was still naked while
  everyone else was in the hall with gear.  We got a quick breakfast and lunch-to-go at Heart and
  Soul Diner and we were driving by 8:20 on a clear, sunny, beautiful morning.  (Note for future years:
  the diner got busier by 8am; it's good we started early).
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  We reached the Scab Creek Trailhead at 9am: a pit toilet, no people but us, and 14 cars in the small lot plus some trailers in the stock
  area.  We broke the scale after weighing Alex at 41 lbs and Steve at 43.  We snapped our group photo and headed uphill and immediately left,
  which switched back to the east atop the ridge.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2023/2023-Wind-River/i-hqqBqQx/0/NCFHjXb3TwdPwJzjBFgVW59C9BfSZfkh23cKkXBwH/4K/DSC01852-4K.jpg">

  <p class="regtext">
    The first two hours were non-eventful. There was decent shade, decent views behind us, but nothing noteworthy ahead -- just a modestly uphill trail through
    forest, with some stock poop and flies.
  </p>

  <div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2023/2023-Wind-River/i-CFscn4j/0/MfhDbF3HQqVVM6rC6ktSXcw5SBH6KZSLrTWhRNcbh/4K/DSC01854-4K.jpg">

      <p class="caption">Looking backward (southwest), toward the plains</p></div>
    
    
    <p class="regtext">
      And really, the next four hours were more of the same: generally uphill, modest grade, forested, not much to see. Trail quality varied from fine to
      mucky and unattractive. We passed a few ponds, then
      ate lunch at Divide Lake -- campable (though not particularly scenic) and the first easy water so far. 
      We had passed one group fishing, one camped at Divide, and one outbound.
</p>

	<p class="regtext">
	  The meh trail experience continued until about 3:45pm, when the trees abrupty open to a huge meadow ringed by peaks: ah, we finally
	  reached the good part!
	  
	</p>

  <div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2023/2023-Wind-River/i-Ts4cLk5/0/MwR4jVC3cVGbdgMxLZrbqMfrDt49R4KjTjLkT9jZH/4K/DSC01863-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">The first real views, and they were great</p></div>

    <p class="regtext">
      We quickly worked across the meadow and its three shin-deep crossings and made Crescent Lake within a half hour. Despite a forecast
      of rain and frequently audible thunder, we had remained dry.  The local wood was not so dry and it took 1.5 hours til the coals were
      ready for cooking.  Starting our appetizers around 6:30, the last steaks came off the fire around 8:00, just as the sun was falling
      behind the ridge.

    <p class="regtext">
      The meal produced a discussion of its own.  Pilaf, creamed spinach, polenta, hybrid wagyu, spicy edamame, key lime pies, and vegan macaroons:
      Roger and I declared it our best steak dinner of the year.  Steve declared it his #14.  The rest said solidly a top-5 meal of the year.
      And we had the timeless debate, as yet unresolved, about 4 vs 8 key lime pies.
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      It turned out to be a beautiful day and night despite the always threatening rain.  We had a great site, open yet sheltered, with
      views across Crescent Lake to Mount Bonneville.  The Mosquito Dome even seemed to be working. The map showed 9 miles of travel; GPS showed 10.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

    <p class="regtext">
      The rain finally came before dawn -- we were nearly in a fog, with a gentle pitter-patter that induced my best sleep of the night.
      John and Bill were already awake when I got up at 6:30. Though still cloudy and damp, it didn't rain during the breakfast taco
      prep, and we even got a few bits of glorious sun around 10:00.  The dampness made for really slow packing, and we weren't walking
      until after 11:00.
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      Taking the south trail around Dream Lake required a lengthy and dicey rock-hop, which all survived.  Dream Lake was a slate
      mirror in the foreboding light.

	  Within minutes the foreboding turned into actual boding (?) -- a vigorous 15 minutes of hail.  Yet by minute twenty it broke and we could
	  see blue sky again in the west.  What glorious and powerful skies.

      This stretch -- along trail 7094, then off-trail between Dream and Raid Lakes -- was one of our top all time meadow walks,
      reminiscent of 
      <a href="https://senexada.github.io/2011-GoldenTrout.htm">Siberian Outpost in Sequoia National Park</a>.
      The open meadows were framed by craggy peaks and
      wild unsettled skies -- and no people.

	We saw one section hiker as we briefly crossed the CDT (Continental Divide Trail), a veritable highway in these environs, though only 18 inches
	wide.  Then we followed the clear and quality usage trail along the north side of the stream that drains Bonneville lakes. The valley has some
	thick willows, so the trail was essential for quick travel. It delivered us to an outstanding spot on Bonneville Lake 10521: a lake fed by waterfalls
	and nestled in a 2000 foot deep valley.  We had the whole place to ourselves: we saw no one on this stretch, or really all day,
	except for the one hiker on the CDT.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

    <p class="regtext">
      I slept poorly due to the foam mat on rocky ground, and thus was awake early enough to beat even Bill,
      who seems to always be wandering around camp before I'm moving.  The two waterfalls and some chirping
      birds were the soundtrack to the dusty pink dawn behind the peaks. Moments like this are why I do it.

<p class="caption">Dawn at Bonneville</p></div>
    
    <p class="regtext">
      There are times -- when cold, exhausted, with altitude headache, sleeping poorly, neck aching -- when I wonder if it's
      worth it.  Then God provides a morning like this.  I walked 18k steps yesterday and 27k the day before, just five months
      after breaking my kneecap, and I've had no pain.  The past two days had numerous throwbacks to prior years: Dancing
      Bear wine, like our first night in Glacier; the Highline above Dream Lake, like Siberian Outpost; this morning's pink
      dawn, like East Lake in King's Canyon; the trout fishing, like we had hoped for in Golden Trout. The setting was magical
      for reflection.

	  I wore every piece of clothing during pancake time.  The sky was cloudy and gusty and unsettled. It simply felt cold.
	  Rain seemed imminent
	  but again spared our breakfast.  Then Bill, John, Steve and I departed up-valley for a day hike to Sheila Lake.
	  It felt destined to rain (or worse) at any moment, but the day hike wasn't going to hike itself.
    </p>

	<p class="regtext">
	  Ten minutes into the hike, as we finished a talus field on the north side of our lake, the hail arrived
	  in earnest.  We each sheltered in various shrubs from the pea- to marble-sized hail. When the worst had
	  passed, we resumed travel and found Steve, who had run ahead in shorts and t-shirt, shivering
	  in a copse of trees.  The wind chill was probably in the 20s when the front blew through.

	We didn't find any clear trail after this point; we scrambled up the ledges on the north side of the stream.

	  After a long rocky traverse of the Bonneville lakeshore, then a gentle climb, we reached Sheila Lake.  Steve scrambled a good ways up the

	  We returned along the north shore of upper Bonneville and were surprised to find three hikers sunning at its outlet.
	  We said hello and crossed to the south side of the outlet, thinking it would be gentler than the ledges we had scrambled
	  to get up the valley.  But it turned out to be thick with willows and almost certainly slower & more difficult, both in the
	  upper and lower reaches.

	  Episodes of wind and rain interrupted dinner; at one point two people held a tarp over Suhas as he shaped the pizza dough.
	  It took about three hours to cook all the pizzas -- but they were amazing, and we ate them during the golden hour when a
	  bit of welcome sunshine appeared.  
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      It was a great day. The day hike was interesting but not too hard.  It was magical to experience the hail storm and the
      mountains shrouded in mist.
    </p>

	<p class="regtext">
	  The final discussions were about -- you may have guessed -- bombing out the next day.
	  The cold winds, rain, hail, and snow had softened our party's resolve.
	  A wet morning would almost certainly slow us enough to dissuade an early exit, but
	  if the morning proved dry, who knew what would happen.  An interesting wrinkle is that
	  I had genuinely lost the best map on day two.

      The morning was misty. We cooked oatmeal in light rain.  All gear was wet so an early departure -- and thus early exit --
      seemed unlikely.

    <p class="regtext">
      Then at 10:00 glorious sunshine appeared and the drying commenced.  The motivated members were packing and walking
      in 20 minutes, with the rest of us trickling out after.  We made a rapid descent to the CDT, then retraced our
      off-trail route between Dream and Raid lakes.

      We decided to head southwest, off-trail, toward trail 7110.  It was a good choice: direct, easy terrain, and only
      one small stream crossing.  As we touched trail 7110 we passed an old cabin with a phenomenal view.

      As we continued downhill in the forest it began to rain -- first a little, then a lot.  We had more hail and a little snow,
      then steady rain for an hour.  The trail was a mess.  Surprisingly we saw quite a few groups of people and stock heading inbound.

	  We had skipped lunch. By 2:20 those of us in the rear reached the huddled, drenched, cold, and hungry leaders.  Having stopped
	  moving for a few minutes, they were near shivering.  And they had voted already without us.  Which kind of makes sense for a wet,
	  shivering crowd.  There was no compelling reason to set camp in these conditions.

        <p class="regtext">
	  So we walked another four hours, reaching our cars at 6:15, having taken 38k steps for the day (and my knee: still good).

<p class="regtext"><b>Retrospective</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  The Winds have a wild reputation that we witnessed firsthand: furious rain and hail storms, and even snow, interleaved with
  gentle sunny moments.  Several times I was the coldest I've been in years: wearing every piece of clothing, yet damp
  and on the verge of shivering.  The running shoe is suboptimal in those conditions.  The rain and wind prompted another
  early exit, but the trip was nevertheless a success, with plenty of memorable and brilliant episodes.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  The Winds also have a reputation for summer crowds and summer mosquitos, both of which we largely avoided.  The busiest stretch was from the trailhead to the meadows,
  where we passed multiple parties of people and stock in both directions.  On the middle days we were mostly alone, with no stock and
  very few people.  Getting off the officially-maintained trails seems to do wonders.  The Great Outdoor Shop told us that we got lucky
  on the mosquitos, with a freeze that killed them early this year.  It would be fun to explore this area after Labor Day, though doing so would
  require more cold-weather preparation.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Gear notes:</b>
<ul class="regtext">
  <li>John's Mosquito Dome might have actually worked</li>
  <li>Foam seat is useful when everything is damp</li>
  <li>I think I'll switch back to inflatable pad</li>
  <li>Backup map is important: I lost our primary</li>
  <li>John's Sea To Summit Ultra Sil daypack looked pretty great</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Strategy/Logistics notes:</b>
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li>Our food needs are diminishing with age</li>
    <li>This particular trailhead had exceptionally easy access (road quality)</li>
</ul>

<b>Fuel usage:</b> 
8 people, 3 nights, steaks and some pizzas on campfire: used 4 (maybe 4.5) x 8oz isobutane
</p>



<p class="regtext">
<b>Food: 8 people</b>
<ul class="regtext">
  <li><b>steaks and sides</b> -- 25oz pilaf, 2x 11oz creamed spinach, 1x 16oz polenta, olive oil, 8x 9oz hybrid wagyu, 2x 15oz edamame, 4x key lime pies, 4x vegan macaroons, 2(?) bottles wine. Tons of food. We finished it all, but barely.</li>
  <li><b>breakfast tacos</b> -- 16 large eggs, 1lb bacon, 16 tortillas, 16oz shredded cheese, 2oz hot sauce, salt+pepper, 1x small onion. Good amount.</li>
  <li><b>lunchmeat pitas</b> -- 28oz pitas, 32oz turkey, 16oz cheese slices, 0.5 small onion, 4 roma tomato, 2 avocado, mustard powder, italian seasoning. Way too much. Don't bring pitas; people prefer tortillas, maybe just 1 each. 3/4 the meat/cheese is adequate. Prefer real mustard and real mayo.</li>
  <li><b>pesto pasta?</b> -- don't have notes</li>  
  <li><b>pancakes</b> -- Bill's recipe. Just right.</li>
  <li><b>cheese, crackers, meat</b> -- Bill's amounts. Just right. Always looks small but is deceptively filling.</li>  
  <li><b>pizzas</b> -- Suhas's recipe. I have it somewhere but haven't posted it online yet. Filling & perfect.</li>
  <li><b>oatmeal</b> -- per person: 2oz oats, 1T chia, 1.5T brown sugar, pinch salt, 1oz raisins, 1oz walnuts. On the light side.</li>  
</ul>
