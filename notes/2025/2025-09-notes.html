<h3>Calibre for converting ebook formats</h3>

<p>This was a huge pain in the ass. 40+ minutes. Most of the time is spent figuring it out and configuring.
Once installed, a second ebook should be faster.</p>

<p>1) Buy book on kobo.com -- note: do not login with google, because you can't add password later
  (and thus you can never login via their desktop app etc)</p>

<p>2) Click to books, select book, click dot-dot-dot, click download.  It will download a tiny "key" file .acsm that can only be loaded in abode digital editions.</p>

<p>3) Install Adobe digital editions. This is also kinda a pain in the ass to find the link (app store doesn't work), but is freeware.</p>

<p>4) Double click the .acsm file. It will open in Adobe. Adobe will ask you to "authorize" -- no idea what that means.
  I chose authorize without an account. It churned for a while then said fine. At this point the epub is in <strong>~/Documents/Digital Editions</strong></p>

<p>5) Install Calibre. At this point the ebook won't open in Calibre due to DRM.</p>

<p>6) Manually install plugin of DeDRM by downloading zip file from https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/releases , then doing
  <em>Calibre -> Preferences -> Preferences -> plugins -> load plugin from file --> select zip file</em></p>

<p>7) Restart Calibre so the plugin is fully loaded</p>

<p>8) Add Adobe Digital Editions key to Calibre: get back to the plugin, choose DeDRM --> customize. Then add keys. Then I pressed "+" and it auto found and loaded the ADE key.  I think the key manually exists in <strong>~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Digital Editions/activation.dat</strong></p>

<p>9) Then I could add the epub (file from step #4) to Calibre. I could double click it and actually read it. Good, that means calibre can see the doc.</p>

<p>10) Click Caliber icon for "Convert Books".  Choose epub and then ok (takes a few seconds).
   Then I repeated, choosing pdf and then ok (takes a few seconds).
   At this point the epub and pdf files are in <code>~/Calibre Library/&lt;author&gt;/&lt;title&gt;/</code></p>
