<h3>Camping / hiking / backpacking</h3>

<ul>
<li>sectionhiker.com on backpacking pillows -- suggests
NEMO Fillo, Sea-to-Summit Aeros, Klymit Pillow X, Exped Air Pillow UL,
and Cocoon Hyperlite.  I ultimately bought z-packs (lighter).
The Klymit Pillow X is the most interesting one I would try next. --

translated" and unable to find the original -- AI says there are two sentences in original
French, one by Napolean, one by the interviewer, that were creatively expanded into the
longer English version:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Can you tell me who Jesus Christ was?"</p>

<p>Well then, I will tell you. Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne and I myself have founded
great empires; but upon what did these creations of our genius depend? Upon force.
Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this very day millions will die for Him.</p>

<p>I think I understand something of human nature; and I tell you, all these were men,
and I am a man: none else is like Him; Jesus Christ was more than man.</p>

<p>I have inspired multitudes with such an enthusiastic devotion that they would have died
for me.. but to do this it was necessary that I should be visibly present with the
electric influence of my looks, my words, of my voice. When I saw men and spoke to them,
I lighted up the flame of self-devotion in their hearts..</p>

<p>Christ alone has succeeded in so raising the mind of man toward the unseen,
that it becomes insensible to the barriers of time and space. Across a chasm
of eighteen hundred years, Jesus Christ makes a demand which is beyond all others
difficult to satisfy; He asks for that which a philosopher may often seek in vain
at the hands of his friends, or a father of his children, or a bride of her spouse,
or a man of his brother. He asks for the human heart; He will have it entirely to Himself.
He demands it unconditionally; and forthwith His demand is granted.</p>

<p>Wonderful! In defiance of time and space, the soul of man, with all its powers
and faculties, becomes an annexation to the empire of Christ. All who sincerely
believe in Him, experience that remarkable, supernatural love towards Him.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is unaccountable; it is altogether beyond the scope of man’s
creative powers. Time, the great destroyer, is powerless to extinguish this
sacred flame; time can neither exhaust its strength nor put a limit to its range.
This is it, which strikes me most; I have often thought of it. This is which
proves to me quite convincingly the Divinity of Jesus Christ” </p>

<h3>Mass conditioning by John Oliver</h3>

<p>Quote from 4chan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The subject of john oliver came up when a colleague (fellow psychologist) and I were discussing
 politics a few months ago. Although we were both in agreement regarding the general shitlib inanity
 of the HBO show, my friend was surprised when I explained that the real insidiousness of it is its
 unmistakably hypnotic structure and pacing.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling up an episode or two off of youtube to show her what I meant.
 All of the segments I've ever seen from this show follow the same repetitive format:
 persent some "argumentation" and "facts" for about 10 seconds, then quickly follow
 these up with a snarky quip (which themselves overwhelmingly take the form of complete
 non-sequitor or otherwise absurd metaphor) before any rational processing of the preceding
 argument can take place in the mind of the viewer. Further telling is that the only 'beats'
 or mental pauses in the show's pacing exist solely to highlight the approving laughter
 or applause of the studio audience.  Repeat this basic formula without variation 20-40 times
 in a row and you have one of the 12-20 minute 'segments' that form the backbone of the show.</p>

<p>The end effect is (obviously) not to deliver information, but rather to literally teach the
 viewers -- on a subconcious level -- to mentally associate derisive laughter with any
 person or opinion that is at odds with the narrative's take on the chosen issue. And it
 accomplishes this by maintaining a strict adherence to a roughly 20-second cycle in which
 a stimulus is presented, and a response is cued. This is the sense in which the show is
 fundamentally hypnotic in effect -- even moreso than its precursors in the genre (Daily Show,
 Colbert, etc).</p>

<p>To my mind, oliver's show is representative of the media's increasing mastery of the
 methodologies of mass conditioning; in fact it is almost such a perfect technical
 accomplishment that I would almost have to admire it on technical grounds, which moreover
 is in the hands of the entirely wrong people.</p>
