We began slowly, with thunderstorms disrupting the delicate Denver
airport. We arrived Idaho Falls at 2am without two essential bags.
Instead of driving for the hills on Saturday morning,
we sat in the hotel lobby brainstorming the minimal set of gear we
would need to locate & purchase to rescue the trip.  But thankfully, the

The initial miles are forested, 
and meadow, with the mountains coming into view only after the halfway point. Given

The first couple hours were
easy, nearly flat, and 
passed us going downhill while we rested above the first bridge over based on

our route.
