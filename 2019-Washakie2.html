There is something soothing about the multi-hour pancake ritual on the stationary day.  
While Alex searched for a swimming hole in the untainted wilderness, Steve and I assembled
a river-rock tandoor as a potential pizza oven.

About 1pm, Jason and I departed to explore Jeff's Buttress (as noted in last night's campsite photo) and beyond.
It did not disappoint.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We reached the buttress itself in just over an hour of steep hiking with a few scrambles.  To the south and east, we saw our
campsite and tomorrow's route over the unnamed pass at the Higgins headwaters. (You can barely see our tents in the high res version, near the river)

And looking west and northwest, the crow can fly 60+ miles before seeing a road. 
Just past the midpoint of that flight, near Hawk's Rest in the Thoroughfare region of Yellowstone,
is the farthest point from a road in the lower 48 states.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Though remote, the Thoroughfare is a busy area of Yellowstone, popular with outfitters.  
Many summer days register 100+ people and 200+ mules past the ranger cabin <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.
We, in contrast, saw no one for five days in these marvelously scenic adjacent lands.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Continuing upward from Jeff's Buttress was a delightful, meanindering ridge stroll.
We were circled by Ospreys and eyed by leery elk.  
This area is so remote than many of the peaks, streams, and valleys are unnamed.
I was particularly attracted to the unnamed valleys southwest of Mount Burwell, which
may make an excellent future destination.

Upon our return, the pizza oven was cold, due to abandonment after Bill's midday trial caused a river rock to fracture.
We don't need that type of injury this far from a road.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
But thanks to 2.5 hours of clever pan management , Suhas and his sous chef delivered seven
pizzas of superlative quality.  It was such visually appealing food in such a wonderful setting that I will break my
usual prohibition of millenial-style food pics.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Four</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
We were hiking within ten minutes of our target time (of 9:30). The hike followed Higgins
fork uphill at a gentle slope, up and over an unnamed just-sub-11k' pass.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2019/2019-08-Washakie/i-BcJZxGP/0/55c5ede0/X4/2019-08-26-DSC01192-X4.jpg">

<p class="caption">Looking forward down the next valley (note us on trail in foreground)</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
Does hiking get better? Massive green valley after green valley, clear skies, near-continuous 360-degree views,
not a soul, and so seldom visited that large features remain unnamed and the trail frequently vanishes.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The Absoroka Range (pronounced Ab-sork-a) is igneous, which I feared might be black, ugly, and monotonous.
The opposite was true. Grasses & lichen cover the hillsides far above the treeline.  The ridges are rounded,
presumably due to more rapid erosion. Together these features make for excellent off-trail travel.
Many of the ridges to our left (along the Park / Fremont County boundary) looked hikeable from this side, 
in particular the two valleys north of Dollar Mountain.  A future off-trail shortcut through that area may be excellent.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We had some trail confusion as the Absaroka trail leaves Caldwell Creek
and turns southeast.  Within 40 minutes we had found the trail, hiked above a gorge with
waterfalls and beautiful pools, and stopped for lunch at the first crossing of the unnamed stream.
This short stretch was the least scenic of the trip -- weird topography, limited views, and dead trees --
and thus I lack worthwhile photos.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
What I don't lack are notes about lunch.  The sandbagging discussions intensified as Roger sowed
his usual confusion about an early exit.  There were numerous factors this year: shortcuts over
the unnamed passes; losing the trail (was it intentional?); availability of hotel rooms; Steve's nalgene malfunction that
soaked his down sleeping bag; length of bathroom breaks; shifting alliances.  To foreshadow the
result, I had learned my lesson from prior trips and had carefully chosen a route that required
extreme mileage to exit early.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The unnamed creek continued up the most stark, lunar-like scenery of the trip, with lava rocks and
little vegetation.  Near the top of the valley was a striking peach-colored mountainside, but the
valley was so cramped I couldn't fit the entire mountain into the photo.
</p>

<p class="caption">A striking hillside</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
Beyond the unnamed pass was, you guessed it, another miles-wide, beautiful valley, the Bear Creek drainage.
</p>

<p class="caption">Kind of backlit, but worth including</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
The hike down was really neat.  Suhas compared the look-and-feel to Lamar Valley in Yellowstone.
The trail often disappeared completely in the rolling grasslands. 
Apparently the stream descent gets cliffy, but we stayed high & left and followed the wooden posts
(spaced several hundred yards apart and sometimes missing or hard to spot) along the correct route.
 Across the valley we spied a herd of elk, our best count being 57.
Spooked by us, we watched them run in five minutes what would cost us a good part of an hour.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
After an hour we reached the valley floor and briefly considered stopping. It was past 4pm, we had gone 8.3 miles,
and no one was particularly energetic.  However, the 900' up and over Bear Creek Pass had to be done one way or
another, and doing it today would make for an earlier exit and meetup with Padraig. In fact, it was possible 
Padraig would be hiking up toward us and we could meet him in the home stretch along Wood River. 
</p>

<p class="caption">Up Bear Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
The trail followed the Bear Creek stream bed and was hard to discern. Mostly we walked in the bed itself. 
At Bear Creek Pass (our final 11k' pass) the wind briefly subsided, giving us a few ridge-top minutes of quiet 
serenity.  We descended the steep mountainside into the long, peaceful shadows of the approaching sunset.
</p>

<p class="caption">Toward final camp</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
We camped at the first flat spot along Wood River, where Steve had to frighten off grazing cattle.  In our
weariness, and the now-resumed wind, it took a surprisingly long time to cook pesto pasta.

<p class="caption">Umm, is it still not ready? Nope.</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
Padraig had not hiked up to join us, but no worries, he was probably spending one more night in a hotel
and would meet us in the morning at the parking lot.  In fact, he was having an adventure of his own!

<p class="regtext">
We drove into the haze from Best Western Arlington, hoping for favorable winds.  After Darrington, Suiattle River Road
 took us 45 minutes into thickening forest. On this particular Friday morning (Aug 17)
there were 6 cars at the Suiattle River trailhead.  Upon opening the car doors, the sound of rushing water overwhelmed the senses.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
An evocative primordialism pervades the entry hike, a vertical mile below our typical trailheads and near our continent's
only temperate rain forest.  Like Degobah, it shows no signs of civilization but massive lifeform readings. 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The trail, often a yard wide and spongy with pine needles, curves along the milky Suiattle in its long, roaring, continuous rapid.
The mighty trees reach eight feet in diameter and rise to neck-craning heights before disappearing into the canopy.  Their trunks are
among the straightest lines in nature.  Everything is green: the boughs and canopies, the moss on the trunks, the ferns and
lichen on steep hillsides.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The trail steepens after the Canyon Creek suspension bridge then steepens again on Miner's Ridge Trail.  A few rare openings offer a glimpse of Glacier Peak, majestic despite the haze.
</p>



<p class="regtext"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p class="regtext" id="footnote1">[1] Gary Ferguson, <i>Hawks Rest; A Season in the Remote Heart of Yellowstone</i>, Chapter 3 (p. 55): 
<blockquote class="regtext">
Beautiful as it may be, this most remote region in the lower 48 is by far the busiest
slice of backcountry either of us have ever seen. [...] Until late August not a single week
will pass when Hawks Rest isn't wrapped in shouts and whistles and dog barks and horse bells

</blockquote>
</p>
</p>




<p class="regtext">
After breakfast we walked the final hour to the crest of Miner's Ridge. This section had no water but copious huckleberries and occasional strawberries.  The smoke thickened until it smelled constantly like campfire.  Meridian sunshine threw the soft pastel shadows of dusk.
</p>


<br/>
<p class="regtext">
At Miner's Ridge lookout we met Russ doing his month-long volunteer stay for hospitality and restoration.  He told us some history of an earlier helicopter crash, the deadfall preventing stock access, the horses that died on the lower trail, and how he drinks unfiltered water.  Visibility at noon was four miles and declining as we finished the ridge walk to Image Lake.
</p>
<br/>


<p class="regtext">
We abandoned our plans for Canyon Lake (another 8-ish miles directly toward the Bannock Lakes fire).  Bill and I scouted ~30 minutes to Lady Camp, which had a clearing about the size of Sunnybrook, though nestled against trees with views of a sloping meadow.  A stream was close but was only trickling. 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We camped at the group site (plenty large) with three couples also in the area.  Russ came by to warn us of a "smoke storm."  As the smoke thickened, the moon glowed weakly orange, the nearest ridges were indistinct, and my eyes and throat began itching.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
A browsing deer nearly stepped on JC.  After our two hour pancake ritual, the eight-party talks began.  With even JC unsure about a day hike, things looked grim.  No one was enthusiastic to stay and some were eager to leave.  We decided to do the full ~15 miles, -4600' (net) to the cars.
</p>


<br/>

<p class="regtext">
Poor Russ had a "smoke cold" and warned of lightning and continuing smoke.  We left him our surplus cheese and berries and we hauled some of his trash.  Even in the haze it was pleasing to pick berries on the descent.
</p>

<br/>


<p class="regtext">
Excluding the time talking to Russ and lunching at Canyon Creek, we descended in about six hours.  Twenty people had signed the register since our entry 2.5 days ago.
