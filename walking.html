<a href="https://archive.org/stream/jstor-1798466/1798466_djvu.txt">Exploration up the Moisie River,
to the Edge of the Table-land of the Labrador Peninsula</a> (1864)
describes snow-capped peaks "distant two days' journey in snow-shoes (about 60 miles)."

In his introduction to the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/firstcrossingofg00nansuoft">First Crossing of Greenland</a>
(1890), prominent artic explorer Fridtjof Nansen calculated that, while pulling 200 lb sledges across
unexplored snowfields, that he expected "a daily average from fifteen to twenty miles, which is exceedingly
little for a 'skilober'".

Lewis and Clark relate
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8419/8419-h/8419-h.htm#link32H_4_0310">a discussion (July 26, 1806)</a>
 in which the Minnetares
"informed us that from hence to the establishment where they trade on the Suskasawan river is only
6 days easy march or such as they usually travel with their women and childred which may be estimated
at about 150 ms."

Similar distances appear in realistic fiction, such as Jack London's
<a href="https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf">To Build a Fire</a>
(1902), a story about walking 30+ miles on a Yukon trail in temperatures of 50 below.
