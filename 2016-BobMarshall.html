<p class="regtext"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ho is this Bob Marshall?
Why have I never heard of him or his wilderness?  What state is it even in?
Queue the back story.</p>

<hr>


<p class="regtext">It started with my discovery of a genuinely useful
publication of our general government: a heat map of distance to the nearest
road in the lower 48 (original pdf is 
<a href="https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/products/publications/21426/21426.pdf">here</a>).</p>

<p class="regtext">My search algorithm was simple: find the biggest
dark green spots we haven't visited.  Future year candidates include the
Olympics, Cascades, Frank Church, and Yellowstone complex.  This year
we chose the largest green blob in Montana, called the Bob Marshall complex,
which covers 1.5 million acres and was named after an early 20th century conservationist.</p>

<p class="regtext">If you think "The Bob" is a strange name, the naming gets even stranger.
The Bob's marquee feature, a 1000 foot cliff
that extends unbroken for 20 miles along the continental divide, is called
the Chinese Wall.  With a description and name like that, we had to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Montana is outrageously beautiful.  The rolling prairies and
mesas, dotted with more cattle and horses than people, surrender abruptly to forest
at the foothills.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-fK3xf8v/0/O/IMG_2984.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-fK3xf8v/0/L/IMG_2984-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Near Augusta, MT</p></div>

<p class="regtext"> At one point we had to stop for three steer occupying the road,
and those steer outnumbered the cars we saw in the hour between Augusta and Benchmark.
The end of the road had a well-marked trailhead, a paucity of cars, and a luxurious outhouse.</p>

<p class="regtext">I'm becoming increasingly partial to the northern Rockies.
They have rivers and green undergrowth. The trails are wild
and scenic but not too high or steep or dry for a first day arrival from sea level
carrying steaks, bacon, sausage, and eggs.</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Our entry day along the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) was superb.
It was gently rolling, well trodden, and with several bridges, allowing rapid travel into
the backcountry with modest exertion.  The view from the first pack bridge, a few hundred
yards from the car, is pure Montana.

<p class="regtext">The trail goes north through shady forest, yielding to
burn scars in the lower valley, yielding to open meadows west of the confluence.</p>

<p class="regtext">It then follows the West Fork Sun, sometimes low in a meadow,
sometimes high enough for a view. </p>

<p class="regtext">Thanks to our earlyish start we traveled 11 miles and made
camp at 4pm just before the Ahorn trail junction. We had hours of sunshine
to cook the steaks and spinach and
assemble the fresh kale salad.  We should strive for more early starts.</p>

<p class="regtext">We felt great. I had no overexertion from a steep climb,
no altitude problems (we were at 5800'), and no dehydration. There
was no wind sapping our heat. We had a campfire to cook ribeye and to prevent
immediate retirement to sleeping bags at sundown.</p>
