<p class="regtext"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur August trip in western Wyoming had two themes: mosquitos and wildflowers. Click photos for full-res versions, and instruct your inner monologue to pronounce Gros Ventre as “grow vont.”</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">An hour’s drive from Jackson we entered Granite Hot Springs valley, which had a fair number of homes speckled among its meadows and wildflowers (how do you get one of those?). We turned at the second signed junction to reach the small lot at 6800′. We started about 10:30am toward Shoal Lake, our destination for the evening:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-dDwBjHL/0/O/IMG_2407.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-dDwBjHL/0/L/IMG_2407-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Looking east from the trailhead</p></div>

<p class="regtext">After two hours of switchbacks up a shaded, damp, &amp; earthy western shoulder, we entered a sunny, gently sloping meadow heaven:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-XL54prF/0/O/IMG_2420.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-XL54prF/0/L/IMG_2420-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Meadows &amp; Mountains</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We ate a leisurely lunch and traversed more meadows along the southern slope of the mountain between Swift and Shoal Creeks:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-gb5gP9j/0/O/IMG_2422.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-gb5gP9j/0/L/IMG_2422-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">You know I love the walking shots</p></div>

<p class="regtext">About 4 hours into our hike we reached our first grand vista from the ridge above the Shoal River valley:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-kfdRsm5/0/O/IMG_2427.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-kfdRsm5/0/L/IMG_2427-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Looking Southeast — can you say “want to ski it” ?</p></div>

<p class="regtext">And looking northeast, you can see Shoal Falls and the upper reaches of Shoal Valley, our destination:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-t8SRfXc/0/O/IMG_2430.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-t8SRfXc/0/L/IMG_2430-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Beautiful</p></div>

<p class="regtext">First we needed to descend ~800′ to Shoal Creek. Each step downwards we were overwhelmed by the grandeur, but were also aware that the surrendered altitude must be regained. In winter this section would be a perfect ski slope, navigable in 3 minutes (idea: do a winter backcountry trip here!). We reached the river and finished the calf-deep crossing in 40 minutes. We started the intimidating ascent around 3pm:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-Tm22zNH/0/O/IMG_2435.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-Tm22zNH/0/L/IMG_2435-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">3pm, and a long additional 2500′ to go</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Having already climbed 2500′, the additional 2500′ constituted an exhausting 4 hours. The trail winds through woods and prairies and mosquito-infested streams, but is occasionally redeemed by scenes like this:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-BnTCWZX/0/O/IMG_2437.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-BnTCWZX/0/L/IMG_2437-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Up Shoal Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">And this:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-dH8qmP8/0/O/IMG_7297_JC.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-dH8qmP8/0/L/IMG_7297_JC-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Upward to Shoal Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">No one was energetic at 7pm when we reached Shoal Lake. Steve was the least rock-hoppy I’ve ever seen him, and we were about to discover why: night one dinner. In our usual tradition, we cooked steaks on an open fire. But Steve had carried more than just individual ribeye steaks — he had also lugged two pounds of polenta, a pound of spinach, several boxes of wine (a highlight! the “best wine” that Alex has ever tasted), and a set of individual key lime pies. No wonder he was tired. Dinner lasted into the darkness; then we retired under a huge moon.</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Day two — I was up at 5:30am after a warm night. Our camp was damp and had copious mosquitos. JC lowered our bear bags:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-ChjkbSv/0/O/IMG_2445.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-ChjkbSv/0/L/IMG_2445-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Morning at Shoal Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">JC’s famous egg &amp; pepper &amp; bacon medley was superb.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-g37wBrr/0/O/IMG_2446.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-g37wBrr/0/L/IMG_2446-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Western Breakfast</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We climbed the ridge above Shoal Lake and turned eastward for several gentle off-trail miles on the shortcut to Brewster Lake.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-QRpJkFW/0/O/IMG_2450.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-QRpJkFW/0/L/IMG_2450-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Off trail travel at its finest</p></div>

<p class="regtext">At one point we found numerous unknown (to us) poops too big for dear but too small for cows. We solved the mystery shortly thereafter when we saw a herd of elk — at least 100? — farther up the valley. As we approached they spotted a stalking wolf; we watched the herd stampede toward the wolf, chasing him over a hill and out of sight. JC got a picture of the stampede after the wolf had retreated:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-szjm5ZG/0/O/IMG_7337.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-szjm5ZG/0/L/IMG_7337-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">In Gros Ventre wilderness, Elk chase you!</p></div>

<p class="regtext">I really like this photo JC made, looking north into the Gros Ventre valley, which we planned to travel later in the trip:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-wTCFLjn/0/O/IMG_7347.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-wTCFLjn/0/L/IMG_7347-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Upper Gros Ventre Valley</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We each chose our own route up the saddle. We took a honey-stinger break from the spot of this photo, in which I was looking across the saddle at Palmer Peak:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-6xz4Tjn/0/O/IMG_2461.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-6xz4Tjn/0/L/IMG_2461-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">The saddle northeast of Palmer Peak</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Then we climbed…</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-KXcw9vq/0/O/IMG_2463.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-KXcw9vq/0/L/IMG_2463-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Scrambling in earnest</p></div>

<p class="regtext">… and climbed…</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-H47BZbk/0/O/IMG_2464.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-H47BZbk/0/L/IMG_2464-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">No hands for JC</p></div>

<p class="regtext">… and climbed…</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-rCnztc4/0/O/IMG_2468.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-rCnztc4/0/L/IMG_2468-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Almost there</p></div>

<p class="regtext">… until we reached the top of “Big Balls of Cowtown” pass, which was really just 30 minutes of scrambling, exactly as described in the Douglas Lorain book:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-dPdZ3Dz/0/O/IMG_7378.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-dPdZ3Dz/0/L/IMG_7378-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Looks cliffy, but we found the magic slot</p></div>

<p class="regtext">This is an excellent opportunity to disparage the metric system in general, and 50m minor contours in particular, which are woefully inadequate for backcountry navigation. Besides introducing up to 300′ uncertainty in measurements (a contour’s worth of error on the top &amp; bottom altitude), it also makes certain large ridges almost undetectable. The old 7.5′ Quads with 40′ minor contours remain the gold standard.</p>

<p class="regtext">We sat for over an hour on the upper tundra. Lunch comprised the ideal proportion of 1 pita, 4 slices of turkey, and 1/3 avocado per person, plus a block of cheddar and a tomato. We began the descent to Brewster Lake beneath puffy clouds around 2:45pm.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-NCKGnkn/0/O/IMG_2473.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-NCKGnkn/0/L/IMG_2473-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Descent to Brewster Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The lakes in the above photo are unnamed lakes that drain into Brewster; Brewster was hidden below another ridge. The key navigational aid, also from Douglas Lorain, is to cross to the northern side of the stream at its outlet from the final unnamed lake above Brewster. The immediate terrain looks like easier smooth rock on the south side, so we tried staying south, but the river gorge deepens and widens quickly. Furthermore, there were snow bridges across the gorge, which we deemed hazardous and prudently avoided; later, from other angles, we verified the perilous depth of crevasses (dozens of feet) and thinness of the snow crusts (in some cases, inches).</p>

<p class="regtext">With the deepening gorge and perilous snow pack, most of us retraced our steps uphill to the lake, hopped across the three foot gorge on solid rock, and walked downhill to Brewster.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-RsV3Nj5/0/O/IMG_7418.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-RsV3Nj5/0/L/IMG_7418-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Finally, Brewster in sight!</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Steve chose instead to continue downhill, routing south around the snow hazards and risking an impassible marsh at the west end of Brewster.</p>

<p class="regtext">We reached the east end of Brewster about 4:45pm, with Steve only 15 minutes behind us. He reported some interesting down-climbing and a spongy and walkable wetland, not the waste-deep marsh I had feared.</p>

<p class="regtext">Alex cooked a hearty &amp; satisfying Jambalaya, the second batch of which we couldn’t finish. Also, for the archives, the dehydrated peas took forever to cook. Jason and I continued our no-tent tradition and in the 2am wakeful hour, while slapping mosquitos, I found myself wondering if the wolf hunted at night and liked the smell of Jambalaya.</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Day Three — our stationary day.  I was awakened by a cloud of mosquitos. The stationary day is ideal for Bill’s berry pancakes with maple syrup. Alex continued to refine his technique for perfectly crisped bacon over an open fire. We eat amazingly well by backcountry standards.</p>

<p class="regtext">JC was psyched to climb Triangle Peak, the massif that towers 1800′ above Brewster Lake (visible on the right side of the photo above). Most people felt lazy, my hip bothered me, and JC faced disappointment until Alex reluctantly agreed. They departed at 11:15am and we saw their tiny silhouettes peek over the summit at 2:45pm. JC’s photo of our campsite shows the steepness and height of the peak above the lake:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-pMnL735/0/O/IMG_7495.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-pMnL735/0/L/IMG_7495-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Looking down on our campsite</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Would you believe that people and tents are visible in that shot? Here is a zoom:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-qPXf5vH/0/O/IMG_7517.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-qPXf5vH/0/L/IMG_7517-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Talk about high and steep!</p></div>

<p class="regtext">JC took more nice photos on the descent — more than I can easily post. Here is the ridge they climbed to the summit, which is the second ridge as you travel southeast from Brewster Lake. They reported it was never narrower than 20′ but I imagine it felt knife-like in places:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-bMcFMnG/0/O/IMG_7524.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-bMcFMnG/0/L/IMG_7524-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Eastern approach to Triangle Peak</p></div>

<p class="regtext">And here is another nice shot illustrating the steepness of the ascent of the ridge. Lunch Lake is in the background.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-NPc4Q6w/0/O/IMG_7465.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-NPc4Q6w/0/L/IMG_7465-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Climbing the eastern ridge of Triangle Peak</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Meanwhile, the rest of us lounged in camp. Steve did hours of laundry (I’m not sure how, but he did). The weather was ideal: warm in the sun, cool in the shade. I laid in peaceful repose on spongy earth among wildflowers, watching the clouds drift by. We had chicken pitas for a late lunch after Alex &amp; JC’s 4pm return and celebratory swim. We attempted to “chop” some wood:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-6xcTHwM/0/O/IMG_7654.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-6xcTHwM/0/L/IMG_7654-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Break Tree on Rock? (fail)</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We cooked tuna melts for dinner: for the archives, each tuna melt had an english muffin, 5oz tuna, 1.5oz mayo, 1.5oz relish, 2T sugar, salt, mustard, butter, and an ounce of cheese. We would have needed more than one tuna melt per person (but less than two) if not for the late lunch.</p>

<p class="regtext">The mosquitos attacked relentlessly. I covered my head in DEET, which created an interesting effect — I could hear teams of mosquitos buzzing inches from my head, but they never landed.</p>

<p class="regtext">A few hours after dusk the moonlight was so bright that the trees threw crisp and obvious shadows. We had another long, bright, and peaceful night.</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Day four — we woke, slapped mosquitos, and cooked steel-cut oats. I took a final photo of our camp before we departed at 9:45am:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-JTk3hP4/0/O/IMG_2495.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-JTk3hP4/0/L/IMG_2495-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Brewster Lake Camp</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We hiked up the little-used and occasionally disappearing trail to the ridge atop Grizzly Basin. More wildflowers, anyone?</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-NwpKzvw/0/O/IMG_2502.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-NwpKzvw/0/L/IMG_2502-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Wildflowers!</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Atop Grizzly Basin at 11:30, JC and Steve separated to attempt an off-trail route through the pass south of Darwin Peak. The near side looked easily hikeable but the far side was unknown; if successful, it would nearly halve their hiking distance to our destination along the upper Gros Ventre River.</p>

<p class="regtext">They were indeed successful, as demonstrated by JC’s photo on the far side. The route required some limited down-climbing. They discovered a cave and other interesting features on their descent.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-59RtvP3/0/O/IMG_7706.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-59RtvP3/0/L/IMG_7706-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Through the crux of the shortcut</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Meanwhile, the rest of us descended miles of smooth, easy meadows framed by distant red cliffs:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-GPjRBBZ/0/O/IMG_2508.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-GPjRBBZ/0/L/IMG_2508-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Yet more meadows — and interesting red cliffs</p></div>

<p class="regtext">After two hours we forded the Gros Ventre (knee deep) and reached “Hunting Camp,” with wooden horse pens and permanent canvas tents, presumably used in autumn. It was deserted now except for an adolescent black bear that bounded away. Our lunch of sausage, cheese, and crackers continues to be one of my favorite fast-and-easy backcountry lunches, especially when there is Gouda.</p>

<p class="regtext">The trail up the Gros Ventre valley was spectacular: it gently curved along the northern edge of a flat valley, half-mile wide, covered in tall green grasses and shrubs, swaying with the breeze. It was incredibly verdant and beautiful. At 2:45pm a thunderstorm rolled north with the line of wind and rain moving visibly across the meadow. We sheltered at the treeline for 1.5 hours of long rumbles and steady rain. Afterwards, the trail was even more spectacular, with its previous beauty now amplified by raindrops, a trillion glistening prisms atop the flowers and shrubs.</p>

<p class="regtext">It was also VERY wet. Within a few hundred yards my feet were sloshing in my boots, which had filled with water running down my legs from the underbrush. It seems unpreventable when traveling in brush during or after a rain storm. We tolerated the soaked boots because only one night remained, but an earlier rain would have demanded a better solution. Perhaps travel in camp shoes (or even sandals?) in those conditions, keeping regular boots packed and dry?</p>

<p class="regtext">The valley continues this way for miles. At one point we looked south and saw the pass that JC &amp; Steve had hopefully traversed. It is the barely-discernible pass between the two left-most distant peaks in this photo:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-qqzPPZq/0/O/IMG_2520.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-qqzPPZq/0/L/IMG_2520-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">South across the Gros Ventre valley, and the unnamed pass</p></div>

<p class="regtext">By the Gros Ventre ford Alex was sick of removing his boots (we had already done several boot-removal fords this trip), so he experimented with an alternative:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-8g9KNNm/0/O/IMG_2522.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-8g9KNNm/0/L/IMG_2522-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Unconventional fording technique</p></div>

<p class="regtext">It didn’t exactly “work” — there was leakage — but I think Alex was mildly satisfied with the result. It was fun to watch.</p>

<p class="regtext">At the next ford, of an unnamed tributary, I too got tired of removing my boots. I attempted to hop across slick rocks and slid into the river, getting soaked to the mid thighs. The mosquitos were so thick that six or eight would land simultaneously. I couldn’t sit still and wait — I had to pace briskly in circles until the others crossed.  As a consequence, I wasn't present to warn Alex about the slick rocks; he made the same hasty decision as me, slipped on the same rock as me, and got the full body soak, all the way to his shoulders.  We were near our hypothetical meeting point so he pushed onward soaking wet.</p>

<p class="regtext">In less than a mile we found Steve &amp; JC along the trail. We camped in the huge, sprawling, upper Gros Ventre basin: note Steve & Bill in conference in the lower center of the photo.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-sZQrxB4/0/O/IMG_2545.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-sZQrxB4/0/L/IMG_2545-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Conference near the final camp</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Everyone was damp from the rain, but the evening was clear. We cooked our classic pesto pasta. For the archives: macaroni was the best pasta yet (easiest to cook and clean); we ate 0.4lbs (dry) per person; 2 tubes of pesto was too little; and all gluten-free pasta experiments for Steve have sucked. We really need to find a Steve solution for pasta nights. Quinoa and fake pastas have not succeeded.</p>

<p class="regtext">At dusk we saw a lot of distant flashes. After dark the thunderstorm arrived in earnest. It lasted all night with high winds, heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. It was quite magnificent. Nothing produces a visceral appreciation for the power and majesty of creation like a thunderstorm in a mighty valley.</p>

<p class="regtext">Just before dawn the rain surrendered to a thick and quiet mist, as if we were in a cloud. The serenity was absolute. As hints of daylight were slowly revealed, the fog sank equally slowly down the valley. I debated including this photo, as it renders so little of the full experience.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-zcth5xF/0/O/IMG_7793.jpg"><img src="https://brownianmotion.smugmug.com/2014/Gros-Ventre/i-zcth5xF/0/L/IMG_7793-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Imagine 30 minutes prior, with barely a hint of light and the mist engulfing you</p></div>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Day Five — the exit day. We evaluated the night’s result. Everything was soaked but the sky was now clear and blue. My $4 tarp was mostly successful burrito-style; I was not dry, but nor was I wetter than the tent dwellers. I am now convinced it is workable in all conditions. Steve’s blisters were so bad he chose to hike in Tevas. We ate instant oatmeal, packed wet gear, and departed at 7:45am. For an hour and a half we hiked the on-again-off-again trail through meadows…</p>

<p class="regtext">We reached the unnamed pass north of Corner Peak at 9:15am. We had a snack and wrung socks (our boots were still soaked). We descended the saddle toward Antoinette Peak.</p>

<p class="regtext">In half an hour we reached the final ridge above Swift Creek canyon. Within moments we stepped from a rocky tundra with brilliant sun above us to a steep valley with thick clouds below us, almost close enough to touch. The sensation was striking and abrupt.</p>

<p class="regtext">We descended the 3000+’ in about two and half hours. The valley is deeply carved and steep. We were grateful to descend this section; climbing it on the first day of acclimation would have been demoralizing.</p>

<p class="regtext">The clouds retreated just ahead of our pace, leaving sunshine as we returned to Granite Hot Springs and our car.</p>

<p class="regtext">We saw no one until we were back in the car. In fact, we saw no one for most of the trip, except for two groups exiting on day 1, and a pair of hikers we leapfrogged on day 1 and last saw at breakfast of day 2. Days 2, 3, 4, and 5 we had the Gros Ventre all to ourselves. That is the beauty of cross-country travel with multiple stream crossings.</p>

<p class="regtext">The trip was exhausting — more miles, more off-trail miles, more stream crossings, and more vertical than prior trips, not to mention more mosquitos. It also had a huge variety of scenery: dry tundra, damp forests, crevassed snowfields, rivers, broad valleys, granite peaks, red-rock cliffs, and multi-colored explosions of meadow. It had the most wildlife: elk, wolf, deer, bear. And it had weather that reminds you of your place in the cosmos. My conclusion: the drenching rains and mosquitos are a worthy trade for that kind of scenery and solitude. Slightly shorter/easier hiking days would be nice.</p>

<p class="regtext">There are many final notes for the archives:</p>
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li>The Lodge at Jackson was solid: comfortable beds and hearty breakfast</li>
    <li>It was surprisingly difficult to find isobutane canisters at 8am; next time phone specifically about isobutane</li>
    <li>I love Honey Stingers before a steep climb</li>
    <li>Read up on techniques for handling damp gear. Ray Jardine?</li>
    <li>We consumed 4 oz white gas and 2.5-3 (estimated) containers of 220g isobutane. We cooked steaks, bacon, english muffins, and boiled some water on a fire (4 meals with some fire use)</li>
    <li>37 miles and 9200′ elevation gain (officially; our travel times suggest we went farther) is at or above most participants’ pleasure level for our style of once-yearly, non-acclimated, gourmet-food backcountry.</li>
