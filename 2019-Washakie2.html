There is something soothing about the multi-hour pancake ritual on the stationary day.  
While Alex searched for a swimming hole in the untainted wilderness, Steve and I assembled
a river-rock tandoor as a potential pizza oven.

About 1pm, Jason and I departed to explore Jeff's Buttress (as noted in last night's campsite photo) and beyond.
It did not disappoint.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We reached the buttress itself in just over an hour of steep hiking with a few scrambles.  To the south and east, we saw our
campsite and tomorrow's route over the unnamed pass at the Wiggins headwaters. (You can barely see our tents in the high res version, near the river)

And looking west and northwest, the crow can fly 60+ miles before seeing a road. 
Just past the midpoint of that flight, near Hawk's Rest in the Thoroughfare region of Yellowstone,
is the farthest point from a road in the lower 48 states.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Though remote, the Thoroughfare is a busy area of Yellowstone, popular with outfitters.  
Many summer days register 100+ people and 200+ mules past the ranger cabin <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.
We, in contrast, saw no one for five days in these marvelously scenic adjacent lands.

Continuing upward from Jeff's Buttress was a delightful, meanindering ridge stroll.
We were circled by Ospreys and eyed by leery elk.  
This area is so remote than many of the peaks, streams, and valleys are unnamed.
I was particularly attracted to the unnamed valleys southwest of Mount Burwell, which
may make an excellent future destination.

Upon our return, the pizza oven was cold, due to abandonment after Bill's midday trial caused a river rock to fracture.
We don't need that type of injury this far from a road.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
But thanks to 2.5 hours of clever pan management , Suhas and his sous chef delivered seven
pizzas of superlative quality.  It was such visually appealing food in such a wonderful setting that I will break my

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Four</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
My water bottle was frozen solid at dawn. We packed, ate quickly, and were hiking within ten minutes
 of our target time of 9:30. The hike followed Wiggins
fork uphill at a gentle slope, up and over an unnamed nearly-11k' pass.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2019/2019-08-Washakie/i-BcJZxGP/0/55c5ede0/X4/2019-08-26-DSC01192-X4.jpg">

<p class="caption">Looking forward down the next valley (note us on trail in foreground)</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
Does hiking get better? Massive green valley after green valley, clear skies, near-continuous 360-degree views,
not a soul, and so seldom visited that large features remain unnamed and the trail frequently vanishes.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The Absoroka Range (pronounced Ab-sork-a) is igneous, which I feared might be black, ugly, and monotonous.
The opposite was true. Grasses & lichen cover the hillsides far above the treeline.  The ridges are rounded,
presumably due to more rapid erosion. Together these features make for excellent off-trail travel.
Many of the ridges to our left (along the Park / Fremont County boundary) looked hikeable from this side, 
in particular the two valleys north of Dollar Mountain.  The hanging valleys to our right (west) look aluring
and worth exploring.  Future off-trail travel through any of these areas may be excellent.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We had some trail confusion as the Absaroka trail leaves Caldwell Creek
and turns southeast.  Within 40 minutes we had found the trail, hiked above a gorge with
waterfalls and beautiful pools, and stopped for lunch at the first crossing of the unnamed stream.
This short stretch was the least scenic of the trip -- weird topography, limited views, and dead trees --
and thus I lack worthwhile photos.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
What I don't lack are notes about lunch.  The sandbagging discussions intensified as Roger sowed
his usual confusion about an early exit.  There were numerous factors this year: shortcuts over
the unnamed passes; losing the trail (was it intentional?); availability of hotel rooms; Steve's nalgene malfunction that
soaked his down sleeping bag; length of bathroom breaks; shifting alliances.  To foreshadow the
result, I had learned my lesson from prior trips and had carefully chosen a route that required
extreme mileage to exit early.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The unnamed creek continued up the most stark, lunar-like scenery of the trip, with lava rocks and
little vegetation.  Near the top of the valley was a striking peach-colored mountainside, but the
valley was so cramped I couldn't fit the entire mountain into the photo.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Beyond the unnamed pass was, you guessed it, another miles-wide, beautiful valley, the Bear Creek drainage.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The hike down was really neat.  Suhas compared the look-and-feel to Lamar Valley in Yellowstone.
The trail often disappeared completely in the rolling grasslands. 
Apparently the stream descent gets cliffy, but we stayed high & left and followed the wooden posts
(spaced several hundred yards apart and sometimes missing or hard to spot) along the correct route.
 Across the valley we spied a herd of elk, our best count being 57.
Spooked by us, we watched them run in five minutes a distance that would take us half an hour.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
After an hour we reached the valley floor and briefly considered stopping. It was past 4pm, we had gone 8.3 miles,
and no one was particularly energetic.  However, the 900' up and over Bear Creek Pass had to be done one way or
another, and doing it today would make for an earlier exit and meetup with Padraig. In fact, it was possible 
Padraig would be hiking up toward us and we could meet him in the home stretch along Wood River. 
</p>

<p class="caption">Up Bear Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
The trail followed the Bear Creek stream bed and was hard to discern. Mostly we walked in the bed itself. 
At Bear Creek Pass (our final 11k' pass) the wind briefly subsided, giving us a few ridge-top minutes of quiet 
serenity.  We descended the steep mountainside into the long, peaceful shadows of approaching sunset.

We camped at the first flat spot along Wood River, where Steve had to frighten off grazing cattle.  In our

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Five</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
We began stirring at 6:30am and were on trail at 8:04.  Suhas achieved super speed on the packed dirt,
and the river crossings this late August were all hoppable.  Within two hours
we passed a fallen gate with sign stating "Administrative Use. No camping", though we didn't know exactly
 how to interpret or circumscribe that command.  Then we
passed the ruins of Kirwin (an abandoned mining town) and reached the parking lot, having seen
no one the entire trip, parking lot to parking lot. That's a first.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
But the parking lot wasn't <i>exactly</i> how we left it. It now had a dilapidated RV, a pit bull, and Padraig
staring us down with a "be cool, don't ask questions" stare.
Oh, the things we learned on the roadtrip back to civilization.  I can only summarize the contours,
the details being inappropriate for this forum.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Padraig had decided to camp at the trailhead last night, and was pitching his tent as the RV sputtered in.
P made the usual peace offerings and got immediate respect and street cred for camping in a tent, given,
the men said, the active male grizzly in the area.  Hmm. They shared some colorful life stories, the mildest
being how the RV was purchased for $500, which included spare tires they sold to recoup some of the cost 
(when prior vehicles got stuck, they just abandoned them and walked on).
</p>

<p class="regtext">
As the campfire-beside-the-RV dwindled, having consumed all the trash, metal, and plastic thrown into it,
Padraig warily began his night in the tent.  And, wouldn't you know, the guys who spent days traveling through
prime bear habitat saw nothing, while Padraig was close enough, in dead of night, to hear a grizzly breathing.
I don't know how he kept his composure.  
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The pit bull, in the hard-sided RV, was apparently going nuts. When they let him outside, he spied
the grizzly and ran back cowering to be let inside.  The commotion, barks, shouts, and honking (from the RV)
scared it away.  I can't imagine sleeping another wink after that. I guess this is what the ranger meant
when he had laconicly described Kirwin as "there's bears up there."
</p>

<p class="regtext">
As we finished packing our cars, the men, toting shovels, a sidearm, and with their pit bull, 
were heading up into the mountains for the hobby they pursued, summer & winter, rain or shine,
on days off: searching for buried treasure.
</p>

<b>Retrospective </b>
<ul class="regtext">
<li>Most solitude yet: zero people the entire trip</li>
<li>Many open slopes & game trails: good area for future off-trail exploration</li>
<li>First day from sea level to 11k -- big headaches the first 36 hours</li>
<li>Should buy backup diffuser and titanium goat grates. Titanium goat are best on the market</li>
<li>Bring lint+vaseline for firestarting on wet days</li>
<li>I need an alt flashlight with red option. Mini maglite is unreliable</li>
<li>Add hydrocortisone to first aid kit</li>
<li>Alex says: put plastic bag <i>inside</i> stuff sack</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="regtext">
Beautiful as it may be, this most remote region in the lower 48 is by far the busiest
slice of backcountry either of us have ever seen. [...] Until late August not a single week
will pass when Hawks Rest isn't wrapped in shouts and whistles and dog barks and horse bells
and beer-soaked snorts and cackles [...] over the next month and a half more than 600 people
will pass, along with two or three times that many horses and mules.
