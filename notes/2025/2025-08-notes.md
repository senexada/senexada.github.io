### Wind River research

* _Bomber Lake_ report -- [Spyderco forum][bomber1] --
  > From here, we continued several more miles through the untracked East Canyon
  > of Torrey Creek. The going was extremely slow, because the terrain consisted
  > of bogs, dead-fall trees, and talus fans. We camped at 9,600 feet elevation
  > in a small meadow beneath towering cliffs.

* _Beyond Trails in the Wind River Mountains_ -- Nancy Pallister --
  [website][pallister] says it will be back in print in 2025, but no other info.

* _Timico Lakes_ [trip report][timico] starting from Meadow Lake -- reports
  burn zone ends at Lake Jaquelin; Lake Barnes fine.
  > This whole area burned during a large wildfire 1988. We were told
  > we would get away from the crowds on this trail and they were correct.
  > We saw one other couple the first day. A solo trekker the second day.
  > Three people passing through the third day, and no one else the fourth and fifth days. Sweet!

* Parts of _Highline Trail_ [trip report][jansjaunts] with numerous pictures,
  including Lake Victor and Bald Mountain Basin. Lake Victor looks really nice.
  > This campsite was perfect. I had views, weather protection,
  > easy water access, and plenty of boulders where I could scramble and explore.

### Misc camping

* Andrew Skurka's [guide to bear canisters][skurka-bear] -- shows Bearikade Blazer 750 cuin @ 33oz,
  BearVault BV500 is 700 cuin @ 41oz.

* Glacier Peak _Ice Lakes_ [trip report][ice-lakes] -- great photos, larches/snow; Ice Lakes
  has minimal tree cover. Is only 8 miles from trailhead (gets day hikers & traffic)

### Old timey strongman

The protein question got me wondering how old-timey strongmen ate.
Which led to fabulous primary sources from early 1900s.
Great stuff in thread.

![Joe Nordquest][joe-n]

Firstly, the strongmen weren't very quantitative on their "macros."  They basically said to eat meat, milk, and veggies.

> Milk is a perfect food, and a splendid drink after exercise is an egg beaten up in milk, 
> or a glass of hot milk. As a rule, the claims of patent or concentrated foods for the 
> would-be strong man should be taken cum grano salis. One preparation, however, which 
> I can conscientiously recommend is that known as "Bovril." It is a fact that most 
> leading athletes recommend "Bovril," and nothing can be better either before or 
> immediately after practice than a cup of hot "Bovril."
> It prevents and dispels fatigue. Oatmeal with milk is splendid for building up the 
> muscular system, as well as cheese, beans, and peas of all kinds, which contain the 
> necessary elements for renewing tissue. I am not a vegetarian, and therefore advise the use of beef, mutton, etc. 
[Arthur Saxon][arthur-saxon]

Or

> We believe in plenty of beef, particularly when in training, supplemented by 
> vegetables and whole wheat bread, which is made of whole rye meal. This diet is 
> further added to by fruit for its laxative quality. To maintain proper elimination 
> we never resort to laxatives other than found in the foods we eat. A light breakfast,
> with the two main meals to follow in their turn is our rule, and about two hours 
> before retiring we take a light lunch which brings on relaxation so necessary to 
> bringing sleep. A person slightly hungry before retiring is not altogether relaxed.
>
> In regard to training I am in favor of a varied program; light and heavy exercises,
>  and I also favor a certain amount of running and jumping and other outdoor exercise of a lively nature.
>
> The lifting of heavy weights appealed to me early in my career, as it 
> imparted to my body a degree of muscular development I think I could not have attained by any other exercise.

This 1937 article contains perhaps the first usage of the idea "there's no food in your food":

![Stop eating foodless food][foodless-food]
[foodless food link][foodless-link]

The head of Harvard's gymnasium in 1904 (Dudley Sargeant, what a name), said average man should eat 125g protein, but then said oh maybe half that.

![Harvard macros][harvard-macros]
[Health, strength, and power; Dudley Allen Sargent, 1904][sargent]

Readers Digest [Jan 1920 article][rd-1920] said about 40-60g protein:

> For proteins take one-third of a pound of meat and two eggs daily.
> Most of our other foods will contain a small amount of protein,
> which will make up the balance of what you need.

But where it really gets fabulous is Physical Culture Magazine.
Circa 1901, and it reads like current year twitter feed + podcast queue.
(the dude who started it changed his name from Bernard to Bernarr because
it sounded like the roar of a lion; he was a vegetarian, hated white bread, and claimed he would live to 150
[source][bernarr-wiki]

All the following from the [April 1901 Issue of Physical Culture][phys-1901] :

* Hybrid of kettle bell and bulgarian bag (p. 3)
* Breath work (p. 6)
* Vegetarianism (p. 8)
* Vax hesitancy (p. 10)
* Doctors pushing tonics (p. 33)
* At-home sauna (30 day trial!) (p. 41)
* Massage devices (p. 44)
* Regrowing hair (p. 47)
* Fasting (p. 51)

And that's just one issue. An enterprising young grad student could probably map every topic
in a Huberman season to an article or ad in the 1900-1910 Physical Culture mag.

The only thing strangely absent was the cornerstone of modern podcasting: selling vitamins.  Maybe vitamins didn't exist back then?
