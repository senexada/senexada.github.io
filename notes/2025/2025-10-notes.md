* __Eastern vs. Western Easter__ -- Julian vs Gregorian calendar --
  [Notre Dame article][notre-dame] --
  > According to the Nicaean Ecumenical Council of 325 AD, Easter should be celebrated on the 
  > first Sunday after the first full moon after the Spring (Vernal) Equinox. All Eastern and
  > Western churches follow this Ecumenical Council ruling. The differences come from the
  > different interpretation of these rules.
  > 
  > The Eastern Christian Churches (Orthodox) follow the Julian calendar in calculating Easter
  > dates, while the Western Christian Churches (Catholic, Protestant) follow the Gregorian calendar.
  > 
  > The Eastern Churches have fixed the above "Vernal Equinox" to be March 21 of the Julian
  > calendar, which currently is April 3 in the Gregorian calendar. So, in Eastern churches,
  > Easter falls between April 4 and May 8, while in Western churches Easter falls between March 22 and April 25.
  >
  > The above "fist full moon after the Vernal Equinox" is not the actual full moon, but it is a
  > calculated, ecclesiastical full moon called the Paschal Full Moon. Eastern churches calculate
  > it using the March 21 Julian calendar Vernal Equinox date, and a method involving the 19-year moon cycle (Metonic cycle) is used.
  >
  >The Western churches use an astronomical accurate time for the Vernal Equinox, which may
  > be on March 20 or March 21 and a corrected, more accurate moon cycle (Gregorian method)
  > to calculate the Paschal Full Moon. To determine the Paschal Full Moon, the exact times of
  > full moon around March 20 are calculated and compared with the exact time of the Vernal Equinox.

  [link to philosophy][kettle-philo]
  > A bodyweight example is doing pullups with a variety of grips (narrow, medium, wide; over, under, parallel, staggered; thumbs wrapped, thumbs over, false; uneven), timing (explosive, slow, with a 3sec pause on the top of each rep, etc.), equipment (a straight bar, parallel bars, rings, towels), and the placement and the nature of added resistance (kettlebells on the feet, a weight belt, a weight vest; bands; chains; artificial controlling environment). In contrast, rows do not constitute SV for pullups.
