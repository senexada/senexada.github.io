Meditations on death
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">1. Jesus wept</h3>
<p class="serioustext">
The shortest verse of scripture.<br/><br/>
God Himself -- omnipotent, omniscient, eternal -- felt physical pain of loss,
 of mourning. He has felt all that we have felt.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">2. Death diminishes me</h3>
<blockquote>
When [the church] burries a Man, that action concerns me: All mankind is of
one Author, and is one volume.  No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main; if a Clod be washed away by the
Sea, Europe is the less. Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in
Mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

<div class="quoteattrib">John Donne, Devotions XVII</div>
</blockquote>

<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">3. Death of a loved one</h3>
<blockquote>
My heart was black with grief. Whatever I looked upon had the air of death.
They could not say 'He will come soon,' as they would in his life when he
was absent. I became a great enigma to myself and was forever asking my soul
why it was sad and why it disquieted me so sorely.  And my soul knew not what to
answer me.

<div class="quoteattrib">St Augustine, Confessions IV</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I hope he will not suffer so much [the loss of his wife] as I yet suffer
for the loss of mine.  I have ever since seemed to myself broken off from
mankind; a kind of solitary wanderer in the wild of life, without any
direction, or fixed point of view: a gloomy gazer on the world to which
I have little relation.

<div class="quoteattrib">Dr Johnson, letter of Dec 1754</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
There is a sort of an invisible blanket between the world and me.
I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want
to take it in. It is so uninteresting.
<div class="quoteattrib">CS Lewis, A Grief Observed</div>
</blockquote>

<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">4. Inevitability</h3>

<blockquote>
With regard to the sharpest and most melting sorrow, that which arises from
the loss of those whom we have loved with tenderness, it may be observed, that
friendship between mortals can be contracted on no other terms that that one must
some time mourn for the other's death.
<div class="quoteattrib">Dr Johnson, Rambler XVII</div>
</blockquote>

<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">5. We consider our coming death</h3>

<blockquote>
And whomsoever these Bells bring to the ground today, if he and I had
been compared yesterday, perchance I should have been thought likelier to
come to this preferment than he. <br/>
<br/>
Now, this Bell tolling softly for another, says to me, Thou must die.
<div class="quoteattrib">John Donne, Devotion XVI</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="serioustext">
We are born to die. Death reveals our smallness and fragility.
</p>

<blockquote>
When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity
before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can see, engulfed 
in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am ignorant, and which knows
me not, I am frightened. The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.
<div class="quoteattrib">Pascal, Pensees 205</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And solemn before us<br/>
Veiled, the dark Portal,<br/>
Goal of all mortal; -<br/>
Stars silent rest o'er us,<br/>
Graves under us silent.<br/>
<br/>
While earnest thou gazest<br/>
Comes boding of terror,<br/>
Comes phantasm and error,<br/>
Perplexes the bravest<br/>
With doubt and misgiving.<br/>
<div class="quoteattrib">Goethe, The Mason</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appeareth for a little time,
and then vanish away
<div class="quoteattrib">James 4</div>
</blockquote>


<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">6. The Tragedy</h3>

<p class="serioustext">
A Comedy ends with happily ever after. A Tragedy ends
with death.  If death is the end, every life is a Tragedy.
</p>

<blockquote>
The last act is tragic, however happy all the rest of the play is;
at the last a little earth is thrown upon our head, and that is the
end forever.
<div class="quoteattrib">Pascal, Pensees 210</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="serioustext">
Death "puts an end to all our schemes, deprives us of all our posessions,"
and begins the dissolution of all we have ever thought, done, or been.
All turns to dust, everyone we know, everyone they will know, <i>ad infinitum</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
Vanity of vanities -- all is vanity. That which befalls the sons of men
befalls the beasts; as the one dies, so dies the other. All are of the dust,
and all turn to dust again.
<div class="quoteattrib">Ecclesiastes 3</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Out out, brief candle!<br/>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br/>
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br/>
And then is heard no more: it is a tale<br/>
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury<br/>
Signifying nothing
<div class="quoteattrib">Shakespeare, Macbeth V</div>
</blockquote>


<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">7. The Comedy</h3>
<p class="serioustext">
A Comedy ends with happily ever after --<br/>
which requires 'ever,' i.e. eternity.
</p>

<blockquote>
He has put eternity into the hearts of men.
<div class="quoteattrib">Ecclesiastes 3</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="serioustext">
God is the transcendant source of being itself, unconstrained by time.
</p>

<blockquote>
If they ask me 'What is his name?' what am I to tell them?</br>
God replied 'I am WHO AM'
<div class="quoteattrib">Exodus 3</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Before Abraham was, I AM
<div class="quoteattrib">John 8</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the One who is and who was and who is to come,
the Almighty
<div class="quoteattrib">Revelation 1</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="serioustext">
God invites us into his eternal being
</p>

<blockquote>
Surely this day you will be with me in paradise.
<div class="quoteattrib">Luke 23</div>
</blockquote>

<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">8. Why pain and sorrow?</h3>
<p class="serioustext">
Mystery. We see through the glass darkly.<br/>
<br/>
Job lost his children and his health, he asked God why, and God
replied with a non-answer.
</p>

<blockquote>
God comes in at the end, not to answer riddles, but to propound them. 
Verbally speaking the enigmas of Jehovah seem darker and more desolate
than the enigmas of Job; yet Job was comfortless before the speech of Jehovah
and is comforted after it. The riddles of God are more satisfying than the solutions of man.
<div class="quoteattrib">Chesterton, Introduction to Job</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="serioustext">
It can point to eternal things.
</p>

<blockquote>
No man hath affliction enough that is not matured, and ripened by it,
and made fit for God by that affliction.  By this consideration of
another's danger, I take mine own into contemplation, and so secure
myself, by making my recourse to my God, who is our only security
<div class="quoteattrib">John Donne, Devotion XVII</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Oh Lord, teach us to keep in mind that we must die, so that we become wise.
<div class="quoteattrib">Bach, BWV 106</div>
</blockquote>


<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">9. Fear not</h3>
<p class="serioustext">
The commonest command of scripture.

A thousand years before Christ, amidst death and illness:
</p>

<blockquote>
I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day
upon on the earth: And though after my skin worms destory this body, yet
in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes
shall behold
<div class="quoteattrib">Job 19</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="serioustext">
Jesus:
</p>

<blockquote>
In the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, for 
I have overcome the world.
<div class="quoteattrib">John 16</div>
</blockquote>


<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">10. If I doubt?</h3>

<blockquote>
What is more difficult, to be born or to rise again; that that which
has never been should be, or that what has been should be again?
Is it more difficult to come into existence than to return to it?

<div class="quoteattrib">Pascal, Pensees 222</div>
</blockquote>

<hr/>
<h3 class="serioustext">11. How does faith look?</h3>
<p class="serioustext">
Bach, from various sources:
</p>

<blockquote>
God's timing is the very best timing.<br/>
In him we live, move, and exist,<br/>
as long as he wills.<br/>
In him we die at the right time,<br/>
when he wills.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, Lord, teach us to keep in mind<br/>
that we must die,<br/>
so that we become wise.<br/>
<br/>
Put your house in order,<br/>
for you are going to die<br/>
and will not keep on living.<br/>
<br/>
This is the old covenant:<br/>
Man, you must die!<br/>
Yes, come, Lord Jesus, come!<br/>
<br/>
Into your hands I commit my spirit;<br/>
you have redeemed me, Lord,<br/>
you faithful God.<br/>
<br/>
Today you will be with me in Paradise.<br/>
<br/>
In peace and joy I depart<br/>
According to God's will;<br/>
At ease is my hear and mind,<br/>
Calm and peaceful,<br/>
As God has promised me.<br/>
Death has become my sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Glory, praise, honor, and majesty<br/>
Be prepared for you, God the Father and Son,<br/>
The Holy Spirit, by name!<br/>
May your divine power<br/>
Make us victorious<br/>
Through Jesus Christ. Amen.<br/>
<br/>
