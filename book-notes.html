<h2>Book Notes</h2>
Started Jan 2017. Ordered chronologically by when I read them.

<h3>Isaac Newton by Mitch Stokes</h3>
Finished reading Dec 2016.
It is a quick, easy read, touching lightly on many aspects of his life.
It illuminates some philosophical debates at the time, especially regarding science
and physics.
<ul>
  <li>3 - born 1642, posthumously, the year that Galileo died</li>
  <li>3 - Devised gravitation "by thinking on it continually"</li>
  <li>11 - Obsessive organizer.  Arranged 2400 nouns in his notebook</li>
  <li>11 - Childhood was solitary reading and building (avid builder)</li>
  <li>21 - Cambridge founded in 1200s upon Oxford dispute. Still taught scholasticism = aristotle + Christianity</li>
  <li>21 - First 1-2 years at Cambridge he took copious notes on scholastic topics</li>
  <li>21 - Tutor Pulleyn was absent; allowed autodidact Newton to do his own thing</li>
  <li>22 - On Pentecost, age 20, listed 58 sins in his notebook</li>
  <li>27 - Copernicus made no new observations; simply offered simpler math</li>
  <li>28 - Galileo introduced quantity, measurement, and experiment into natural philosophy</li>
  <li>28 - Descartes died 1650. His philsophy had ether, vortices, and no desire or forces</li>
  <li>31 - Newton began notebook sections with a list of questions</li>
  <li>31 - Wrote <i>Amicus Plato, amicus Aristoteles, magis amica veritas</i></li>
  <li>33 - Writings on theology > chemistry/alchemy > physics</li>
  <li>34 - Taught himself trig to understand an astrology book. Began Euclid but discarded as a waste of time.</li>
  <li>36 - Masted Descartes' Geometry by restarting book whenever stuck. Sometimes progress was 2 pages per restart.</li>
  <li>41 - Plague in 1665. Moved back to Wollsthorpe for two years. Great fire 1666.</li>
  <li>44 - Boyle's <i>Christian Virtuoso</i> says experimental philosophy assists in being a good Christian</li>
  <li>47 - Developed calculus in seclusion at Woolsthorpe</li>
  <li>53 - Hooke emphasized <i>experimentum crucis</i></li>
  <li>56 - Returned as Cambridge Fellow 1667. Experimentalist.</li>
  <li>62 - Lucasian chair and scarlett robe at age 26 (1669)</li>
  <li>67 - Elected to Royal Society (1672) due to handmade reflecting telescope</li>
  <li>70s - Publicity of Optics caused undesired controversy & correspondence</li>
  <li>77 - "shoulders of giants" is from private correspondence with Hooke</li>
  <li>83 - Millions of words on religion; more than any other topic</li>
  <li>85 - Was familiar with all works of church fathers</li>

  <li>89 - Posthumously published religious works: <i>CHronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended</i> and
    <i>Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John</i></li>
  <li>90 - Thought Egypt and Greece had secret wisdom from Noah, lost as they became corrupt</li>
  <li>93 - That concept found in charter of Royal Society: "attempt the recovery" of knowledge</li>
  <li>96 - Confessed reading Christian Champions as a violation of the Sabbath</li>
  <li>108 - Verified Kepler's ellipses would arise from 1/r2 force in 1679, but kept it secret</li>
  <li>108 - Philosophical point: simple mathematics was seen as proof of correctness</li>
  <li>109 - Gravity was contra Descartes's matter system, in which force reuired contact (ether).
            Jesuits decreed no action at a distance.</li>
  <li>116 - In 1684 Royal Society's big topic is path under 1/r2. Halley travels to Cambridge
            to ask Newton, who immediatly responses: ellipse; I worked it out year ago.
            Newton couldn't find the papers and rederiving it rekindled his interest in math.</li>
  <li>120 - Halley published at own expense the Principia. Third volume done in July 1687, age 44.
            Undermined Descartes with invisible action at a distance.
            Used proposition system like Euclid. Axioms were inertia, F=ma, equal & opposite force.
            Reasoned from those to universal gravitation.  Was ridiculed on the continent</li>
  <li>129 - Pythag -> Plato -> world: God ordered universe with mathematical laws</li>
  <li>131 - Byron's poem: reverse Adam's curse and steam engines will take us to the moon</li>
  <li>137 - Lifetime friend with Locke. Conversed on theology.  Sent letter on corruptions of
