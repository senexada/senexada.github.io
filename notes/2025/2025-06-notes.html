<blockquote>
  <p>In one of the most widely diffused manuals on note-taking, the Jesuit Jeremias Drexel explained:
“Reading is useless, vain and silly when no writing is involved, unless you are
reading [devotionally] Thomas a Kempis or some such. Although I would not
want even that kind of reading to be devoid of all note-taking.”
[...]
This process of “excerpting” was said to aid the memory in at least two ways: the act
 of writing itself helped to ingrain the passage in the memory, and the excerpts
could then be learned by heart to exercise the memory.
[...]
Sacchini, the superdiligent Jesuit, favored copying out passages twice, once
in a notebook kept in the order in which the passages were encountered in the
text, and a second time to sort them under appropriate topical headings</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Middle Ages had come to a natural end by exhaustion, becoming an
intolerable despotic repression of man's physical nature in favor of the
spiritual one. Then, however, we turned our backs upon the Spirit and
embraced all that is material with excessive and unwarranted zeal. This
new way of thinking, which had imposed on us its guidance, did not admit
the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than
the attainment of happiness on earth. It based modern Western civilization
on the dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs. Everything
beyond physical well-being and accumulation of material goods, all other
human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature,
were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems,
as if human life did not have any superior sense. That provided access for
evil, of which in our days there is a free and constant flow. Merely freedom
does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(29) A proper understanding of human intelligence, therefore, cannot be reduced
to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead,
it involves the person’s openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects
an orientation toward the True and the Good. [...]
From this, it follows that human intelligence possesses an essential contemplative
dimension, an unselfish openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful,
beyond any utilitarian purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>(34) Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks
succumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work
they can perform. However, a person’s worth does not depend on possessing specific
skills, cognitive and technological achievements, or individual success, but on
the person’s inherent dignity, grounded in being created in the image of God.
This dignity remains intact in all circumstances, including for those unable
to exercise their abilities, whether it be an unborn child, an unconscious person,
or an older person who is suffering.</p></li>

<h3>OpenSSL stuff</h3>

<p>Years ago I encrypted some files with openssl des3:
<code>openssl des3 -i foo -o foo.des3</code></p>

<p>Trying to decrypt in 2025 on a macbook, it failed with <em>bad decrypt</em>, even when
I had the right password.</p>

<p>It took an hour or so with AI to figure this out.</p>

<ul>
<li>it suggested various options to openssl, like <code>-legacy</code> or <code>-provider legacy</code> --> these all failed</li>
<li>it suggested I <code>brew install openssl@1.1</code> --> macbook failed to install: "not supported"</li>
<li>it suggested running in docker --> this actually worked. Steps below.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The docker steps that actually worked:</h4>

<ul>
<li>download docker from <code>docker.com</code></li>
<li>install docker</li>
<li>create a docker instance:
<ul>
<li><code>mkdir tmp; cd tmp</code></li>
<li>(copy files into tmp)</li>
<li><code>docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/data ubuntu:20.04 bash</code></li>
<li>install openssl 1.1: <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt install -y openssl</code></li>
<li>confirm it is 1.1.1f: <code>cd /data; openssl version</code></li>
<li>actually decrypt using md5: <code>openssl des3 -d -in foo.des3 -out foo -md md5</code></li>
<li>(it took a while to figure out the md5 thing; without it you still get <em>bad decrypt</em>)</li>
<li>(useful trick from ai: use <code>-out /dev/null</code> to isolate password handling from decryption;
if <em>bad decrypt</em> when using <em>/dev/null</em>, then password is wrong, file is corrupted, or
there was an additional <em>-salt</em> flag or custom digest. AI suggested that custom digest
might have been md5 back then. I tried it and it worked)</li>
