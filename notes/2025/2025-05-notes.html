<blockquote>
  <p>In total, it took me about 2 hours to get to the lake from the junction.
  As a campsite, the lake was a huge disappointment. There is no flat shoreline to speak of, 
  unless it was on the opposite (north) shore. Everything on the south shore was forest filled
  with alder. I could have circled the lake on either shore, but on the west shore was another
  avalanche path and on the east was some serious cliffs that would have required gaining a
  bit of elevation before dropping back down. I had been hoping to use the lake as a base for
  exploring the alpine terrain above the lake, but there were only two routes from the lake to
  that terrain. One was an avalanche chute, and the other was a long, steep, dry creek bed
  going up a grassy slope. As I didn't want to camp at the lake, my only other option for
  exploring the alpine was to go up one of those routes to hit the alpine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>whenever you want a drink of water, you have to: Open the bottle,
 Open the Lifestraw‚Äôs top cap, Open the Lifestraw‚Äôs bottom cap,
 Stick the Lifestraw inside, Drink, Take it out, Expel the remaining water,
 Close the top cap, Close the bottom cap, Close the bottle.
 And then‚Ä¶you‚Äôve got a wet Lifestraw, so you‚Äôll probably end up with wet clothes.</p>
