<p class="regtext"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter the prior year's rigor and drenching in Wyoming,
we returned to Cali for a drier, gentler trip.  It was indeed bone dry but its gentleness depends on
your perspective (more on that later).  It also offered a backcountry surprise, something I never expected to stumble upon
in the wilderness.
</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Mammoth Lakes is a beautiful mountain town high in the 
Sierra wilderness, yet trailhead access is tedious.
In summertime, the San Joaquin trailheads are only accessible via
a slow shuttle bus from the gondola. We parked near the gondola about 10am,
boarded a shuttle at 10:40, reached the Devil's Postpile stop (7560') at 11:15, and
hit the John Muir Trail (JMT) at 11:30.
</p>

<p class="regtext">The first mile reminded us that we were indeed back
in California: saturating sunshine, rare shade, cloudless but hazy-from-wildfire skies,
 and the finest of fine Sierra trail dust.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2015/Ansel-Adams/i-BTznntQ/0/O/IMG_2595.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2015/Ansel-Adams/i-BTznntQ/0/L/IMG_2595-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">It begins: sun and sierra trail dust</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We reached the Superior Lake trail in 45 minutes
and began the steady, moderate, and delightfully shady climb westward.
We reached Beck's cabin (9100') three hours later, which included a 
45 minute lunch stop.  From Beck's cabin it took half hour to the foot
of Superior Lake (notably: the first usable water since the trailhead)
and another hour to our destination, the north shore of Beck Lake (9840').
 </p>

<p class="regtext">The photo captures the beauty but not the chill.
At sunset it was a comfortable-sounding 50 degrees, but steady
winds above 20mph sucked away our heat.  Roger was shivering, possibly due
to preexisting weariness from his half-ironman.  Steve had already used
six pair of socks and was hurting, a bad omen for the morrow.</p>

<p class="regtext">Our classic first night meal was perfectly proportioned this time:
6 steaks, 2 bricks of spinach, 1 loaf of polenta, and 4 key lime pies (for six people).
There were dissenting opinions on bringing N-1 steaks on future trips.
The pan fry worked well, but grease cleanup was ugly; an open fire is
far superior. </p>

<p class="regtext">The sun set at 6:15pm and the Milky Way's structure was visible
by 8:35.  We slept early to escape the howling wind. </p>

<hr/>

<p class="regtext">Day two: the damp mist cleared around 8:40am as sunshine
reached our site.  Our plan was to hike up the saddle south of Beck Lake
(visible in the center of the above photo),
then evaluate the feasability of going WSW over the principle ridge into
the Iron Creek drainage. If successful, it would be a great off-trail route
and would guarantee solitude for the following days.  If Iron Creek was not
possible, we could drop into Holcombe Lake.
</p>

<p class="regtext">The gusty winds continued.  Though facing a potentially
long off-trail day, we had the most lethargic morning of any recent trip.
I blame the chill and the uncertainty about the day's goal.
We didn't leave camp until 11:30am. </p>

<p class="regtext">We traveled less than half a mile in the first hour.
Between the late start, the constant wind, the loose footing, and
the various ailments, we had to abort the ascent.</p>

<p class="regtext">
We descended to Superior Lake, ate lunch, and reviewed our options.
The wind was so brutal that we briefly considered aborting the trip.
But we settled on the short journey to Gertrude Lake.
</p>

<p class="regtext">It was an inauspicious day: only 3 hours of hiking.
The highlight was the pasta with butter, mushrooms, and spec.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="regtext">Day three: the stationary day.  It was so stationary
that we didn't finish breakfast until nearly 11am.  But we all subsequently
took the short day trip to Ashley Lake (9544'), arriving at noon.   </p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2015/Ansel-Adams/i-2Fg6sZ7/0/O/IMG_2668.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2015/Ansel-Adams/i-2Fg6sZ7/0/L/IMG_2668-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Ashley Lake and Iron Mountain</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Jason and I were the only takers to summit Iron Mountain (10886').
We chose a long route behind the leftmost peaks in the photo, looping around
the gentler side/back of Iron Mountain.  The initial ascent -- the ridge
between Ashley & Anona -- had a beautiful sage smell.  
</p>
<p class="regtext">The Ashely/Anona ridge was too steep to follow the
ridgeline, and the Ashley side was too cliffy (as expeted),
so we diverted into the Anona drainage to loop behind the ridges.
We got the classic Sierra bright sun, bright chucks of granite. </p>

<p class="regtext">We chose this notch to reach the ridgeline.
It was nervewracking but not dangerous on the ascent, but from its
top we didn't like the look of the downclimb, which will factor into
the story later.</p>

<p class="regtext">At two hours we stopped for lunch at the saddle
below Iron Mountain, with views west to Yosemite and NE to Ashley Lake,
about 1000' below. </p>

<p class="regtext">We made the summit in an additional half hour, but 
the forest fire haze impaired the photo quality.  We departed at 330pm
