  <span class="dropcap">O</span>nly two of last year's eight attendees made it to Yosemite
  this year for a glorious but warm autumn in the Sierra. What were the upsides and downsides?
  Read on to see.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

<p class="regtext"><b>The Arrival</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
I arrived Fresno 8pm with only carry-on luggage (first time attempting it;
simply gave up on packing a knife).  Bill picked me up, we slept
in Fresno, and were driving north to Wawona at 624a on Thu Oct 3.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Along the way we discussed my new equipment this year: the KS Ultralight pack.
It weighs one pound and has a minimal frame.  Way lighter than
an REI pack, just as comfortable, yet also cheaper than REI, despite
being custom hand-sown by a sole proprietor in one of the costliest places
on earth (Japan). Which begs the big-box retail question explored by <i>Flight of the Conchords</i> in <i>Think About It</i>:
<a href="https://youtu.be/TLEK0UZH4cs?t=84">
"What are your overheads?"
</a>
</p>

<blockquote class="regtext">
They're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers.<br>
But what's the real cost?<br>
'Cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper.<br>
Why are we still paying so much for sneakers<br>
When you got them made by little slave kids -<br>
What are your overheads?
</blockquote>

<p class="regtext">
  The ranger station at Wawona Hotel was empty (arriving half hour after
  they opened, we dodged the 8-person opening rush). The ranger surprised
us with his bear advice, so different than the northern rockies: sleep
  *near* your bear cans; act aggressively toward bears, as if the bear is
  a big raccoon; but don't stone them to death,
  which accidentally happened in a Lord of the Flies frenzy recently (oops).
   He also surprised us with the forecast: close to 100 degrees at Hetch Hetchy.
</p>


<p class="regtext">
  A juvenile bear skittered across the parking lot as we arrived at White Wolf
  at 10a. We took our starting photo and began the dirt road walk toward Harden Lake.
</p>

<p class="caption">White Wolf parking lot</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    After passing Harden Lake (not particularly scenic), we admired the trailsmanship of the
    switchbacks down the south rim of the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne.
The first few miles had no veiws; at one point we got a few glimpses of the deep blue waters
  of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (but only Bill's phone has that photo?); as we got lower, the views
  pointed toward Pate Valley and Rancheria Mountain.
  </p>

<p class="caption">Rancheria Mountain</p></div>

<p class="regtext">       
    It was an unusual backcountry entry: a net 3500' of elevation *loss* as we descended
    from the Tioga Road highlands into the furnace of Tuolumne canyon.
    Along the canyon floor we took multiple breaks to soak our shirts in the
    river.
    </p>

<p class="regtext">   
    We crossed the two good bridges in Pate Valley and found a shady campsite in the
    tall pines. It was dark by 7:15p, which foreshadows our biggest challenge of
    this October trip: staying awake until a reasonable bedtime.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
We woke about 620a to maximally benign conditions: about 60F,
no wind, no moisture anywhere, not even a hint of dew.
It is so easy to manage gear like this, compared to last year's
constant hail/rain/snow in Wyoming.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The only "problem" was our ham coldcuts intended for lunch, which had been
at ambient 60F+ for the last 12 hours.  We reasoned that they
were probably fine, but better to sizzle & eat now than wait another
6 hours at daytime temps approaching 90.  Weeks later we consulted
the most reliable part of current year internet -- the message boards --
which verified that we were indeed still alive and unharmed.
(Feel free to skip the blockquotes if uninterested in bacterial
toxin production)
</p>

<blockquote class="regtext">
<a href="https://www.quora.com/I-left-a-packet-of-ham-out-for-8-hours-in-the-cupboard-by-mistake-Is-it-still-safe-to-eat">
  Quora thread</a><br>
  Vegetative cells (e.g. E. coli, Salmonella, etc.) are all destroyed by proper cooking,
  just as you do with poultry. No toxin-producer affects raw meat in 8 hrs.
  The only thing that grows rapidly on raw meat is SPOILAGE organisms.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="regtext">
  <a href="https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/14489/can-i-re-cook-a-ham-that-was-left-out-overnight">
    Stack Exchange thread</a><br>
For example. at 10C (50F), E. coli only manages to divide once every 8 hours or so 
(see Ratkowsky et al., "Relationship Between Temperature and Growth Rate of Bacterial Cultures", J. Bacteriology, vol 169, p. 1 (1982)<br><br>

Edit: In response to a comment about bacterial toxin production, I want to reiterate 
that colder temperatures slow down metabolism of just about everything, including toxin production.
This is because, at a basic physical level, reaction rates are governed by the Arrhenius
equation which translates, for simple reactions, to a doubling of reaction rates for ~10C increase in temperature.
Of course, organisms like bacteria have more complex interactions, but this still gives an order of magnitude estimate.<br><br>

	    Furthermore, research has been done on production of bacterial toxins.
	    For example, Skinner & Larkin (J. Food Protection vol 61 p. 1154 (1998))
	    wrote a paper called "Conservative Prediction of Time to Clostridium botulinum Toxin
	    Formation for Use with Time-Temperature Indicators To Ensure the Safety of Foods",
	    which gives, for food innoculated with the bacteria, a time-to-detection-of-toxin
	    of 2-3 days at 10C. In fact, they did the research because food storage at open-face
	    refigerators in stores often allows products to get up to as high as 10C (at least as of 1998).<br><br>

Similarly, in Bonventre and Kempe ("Physiology of Toxin Production by Clostridium botulinum
Types A and B, III"), their 10-18C toxin line is flat for 24 hours at the baseline
level before creeping up by a factor of 3 or so between 24 and 48 hours (figure 4).
These are just examples, but you find the same general trends everywhere because
of the fundamental physical relationship between reaction rates and temperature.
  </blockquote>

<p class="regtext">
  Walking by 812a, we hoped to ascend the +3500' while it was mostly shaded.
  The angle of the sun and color of the leaves made it feel like autumn.

<p class="regtext">    
    It took 3.5 hours (including all breaks) of steady climbing to reach the trail junction to Rodgers Canyon.
    This section had no water except a tiny seeping stream at the junction, barely enough to harvest.
    We couldn't find the pond it supposedly drains. We ate lunch atop the ridge with a stiff breeze and
    quaking aspens.

<p class="regtext">    
    The next two hours were pretty standard Sierra terrain, mostly downhill, but including a long hot stretch
    through what felt like a rolling sea of granite knolls. We left the trail
    at Piute Creek, going upstream through some dead pine forest followed by a nice
    ledge scramble toward Saddle Horse Lake.  We erred right and cliffed out near
    the Lake Irwin stream, which travels through an impassable gorge. Then we retreated
    and soon reached the saddle at the foot of Saddle Horse Lake.

<p class="regtext">    
    Next was a short but intense bushwack through dense foliage and deadfall along
    the west side of Saddle Horse Lake. 
    Within five minutes we found game trails, which we followed to an aspen-lined
    meadow on the northwest side near its head. It felt like no one had visited
    in a long time; there were no obvious trails, campsites, fire rings,
    or signs of use. We settled among some boulders, cooked jambalaya,
    and watched the pastel California sunset.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>
  
    
<p class="regtext">
The night was lovely, dark, and deep -- new moon for the win.
It was also much cooler, probably about 40F. We watched the valley
come alive with chirps, calls, and rustling as the low October
rays filtered through the aspens about 8am.  I think of aspens as
a Colorado & Utah tree; it was rewarding to see them here, on the verge
of turning yellow.
</p>

<p class="caption">Campsite at dawn</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
    Last night we decided to do an easy day hike to allow flexibility for
    a more efficient exit, yielding time for a shower and In'n'Out.
    We planned to scout the north shore of Saddle Horse Lake and climb
    the hill on its southeast side.
</p>
<p class="regtext">    
    I love the contrast of these trips.  Today we had warm, gentle, dry
    October sun without an insect or a hint of moisture, not even dew.  Last year on day three in Wyoming
    we had rain, multiple hail storms, and high winds.  Each is inspiring in
    its own way.
</p>
<p class="regtext">    
    Our short day hike was pretty brushy and ledgy.

<p class="caption">Unnamed hill SE of Saddle Horse</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
  It offered nice views north toward Benson Lake and the PCT (neither visible here).
  Pleasant Valley is not an ordinary "valley" in the sense of having a clear valley floor.
  It is surrounded by peaks, but instead of an obvious floor there are
  ridges and gorges and knolls that limit the sight lines and disrupt the sense of place.

<p class="caption">Looking North from high point near Saddle Horse</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
    We observed our off-trail travel speed varying by something approaching 10x.
    Smooth, flat rock was as fast as on trail, while scrambling through underbrush,
    ledges, and deadfall could take an hour for each 1/3 to 1/2 mile.

<p class="caption">Bill at midday on Saddle Horse Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">    
    Our short hike finished by 1115a and rather than stay another night, we lounged at
    the lake and then backtracked a couple miles to Table Lake. The ledges were much easier on the way
    down: when routing away from the dry creek and westward, 
    there were nice ramps between the ledges.  As the terrain flattened, we reached a large
    work camp (currently uninhabited) that didn't offer any views, but did offer some
    peaceful cascading pools sized for swimming.
</p>

<p class="regtext">    
    Back on trail at Piute creek, we recrossed the hot, strange topography then
    scouted for Table Lake, which we found within 3 minutes
    of leaving the trail. Finding the optimal campsite along the south shore
    took a few more minutes.  The map shows some marsh & swamp, but we had a nice
    dry site with no detectable marsh or bugs. It was really quite a fabulous
    mix of dry, flat ground, open skies, and just enough foliage to feel comfy
    and protected.

<p class="regtext">
  Soon we were in full sun, hotter by the step, with heat shimmering
  off every granite wall.  We encountered our first person since day one,
  a solo hiker on a week-long trek.
</p>

<p class="caption">Down into the heat</p></div>

<p class="regtext">  
  We stopped to eat and swim in the wonderfully cold water of the
  Tuolumne at a swimming hole beneath the bridge.  This was the
  first "busy" part of our trip, with six people passing as we ate,
  and another few as we hiked down valley.
</p>
<p class="regtext">  
  Two bears, a mother and cub, were foraging 10 yards from the trail
  and largely ignored us until I tried to get a photo, at which point
  they showed enough interest that I chose to walk away. We continued
  through the last bits of fast, level, shady trail.

  Then it was several hours of sweaty, steep switchbacks.

<p class="regtext">  
  We debated whether to stop at Morrison Creek, to continue to
  Harden Lake, or to hike all the way to the car at White Wolf.
  By 430p we had hiked about 12 miles, up and down 3000'+ of
  vertical, in intense heat, which was plenty for me.  We found
  a great hollow below the trail, made ramen, and watched the
  clouds & colors develop over the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne.

We were walking before 8a, reached the car via the non-Harden-lake path
in almost exactly two hours, and took our final selfie. We got to Fresno
in time for the coveted shower and In'N'Out.

<p class="regtext"><b>Retrospective</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  The two-man trip was a nice variation -- numerous campsite options,
  easy decision-making, and lots of conversation time.
</p>
<p class="regtext">  
  Yosemite delivered classic sun-washed granite, gentle evenings,
  glorious sunsets, and essentially no bugs.  The low elevations
  along the Tuolumne (4400') were uncomfortably hot, but the
  higher elevations were perfect.  The alternate
  year Cali vs northern Rockies contrast increases one's appreciation
  of both sets of conditions.
</p>
<p class="regtext">
  Traveling in October was a nice variation.  I liked the changing leaves and
  low angle of the sun.  The notorious Yosemite crowds were absent: the entry
  gate (on Thu morning) had only three cars in line; the ranger station was
  empty; White Wolf trailhead had only a couple cars; and we only saw about
  a dozen people in the backcountry, and aside from two people near the
  trailhead, the rest were confined to two brief time windows in Pate Valley.
  We saw no one on three full days and large majority chunks of days 1 and 4.

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Gear notes:</b>
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li>Bring 1 hydration/salt thing and 3 snacks per day</li>
    <li>Get a red cover for my flashlight</li>
    <li>Look into Soto Stove</li>
    <li>We wondered how many calories could in theory fit in a bear canister
       (even if ridiculous, such as 100% butter). Have not yet computed</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="regtext">
<b>Best map companies:</b><br>  
  Bill asked me to compile these, as 
  the National Geographic maps are uninspired compared to some small
  local makers
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li>Washington - Green Trails Maps</li>
    <li>Montana/Wyoming - Beartooth Maps</li>
    <li>California - Tom Harrison Maps</li>
    <li>Colorado - Outdoor Trail Maps</li>    
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Strategy/Logistics notes:</b>
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li>None this time. We nailed it.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<br/>

<br/>
<p class="regtext">
<b>Fuel usage:</b> 
2 people, 4 nights, nothing cooked on fire. I think we used 1 x 8oz isobutane
</p>


<p class="regtext">
<b>Food: 2 people</b>
<ul class="regtext">
  <li><b>burgers</b> -- two burgers per person? Avo went bad. Tomato, lettuce, salt, pepper. Good amount.</li>
  <li><b>jambalaya</b> -- 1 packet zatarains, 2x 90 cal chicken, 1x 5.5oz (600 cal) sausage.  A lot but ate it all.</li>
  <li><b>ramen</b> -- 2x 3.5oz (460 cal) ramen, 4x 3.5oz (80 cal) chicken, 1x 2.5oz (250 cal) bacon bits, 1x 2.8oz kimchi, 1x 1oz mushroom.
       Mushroom added nothing. Kimchi was key. Good amount I think.</li>
</ul>
