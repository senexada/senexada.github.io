  <span class="dropcap">W</span>e beat the heat this year with daytime
  highs in the 50s, freezing rain, sleet, and snow.  And we made yet another early exit (I am
  sensing a pattern).  As usual, click images for high-res versions.

<p class="regtext"><b>The Arrival</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Pinedale, Wyoming was our staging area and it exceeded all
  expectations. 
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2023/2023-Wind-River/i-nbGzbV7/0/NFD357JPdK9K53JTJdkCD6RGZP5rgcvDtzLD3gxLP/X2/IMG_5241-X2.jpg">

<p class="caption">Pinedale: "All the civilization you need"</p></div>

  
<p class="regtext">
  Pinedale's population of 2,005 is lower than its altitude (even when expressed in meters).
  And yet it had a solid brew pub, a great breakfast spot, and perhaps the best gear store
  we have ever encountered: truly all the civilization we needed.
</p>


  <p class="regtext">
    John described The Great Outdoor Shop "like going back in time." Suhas called it "the
    best shopping experience I've had in a long time."  Roger noted that they managed to upsell
    Jeff, John, and Steve.  And we all expressed surprise that fraud control didn't decline John's
    multiple transactions that I think reached 4 digits.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    We debated bear spray, with Roger noting that in 12 years, we have sprayed zero bears and
    three people.  Yet they managed to sell us the bear spray too.  The Shop employees confirmed
    that it's always good to have a Captain Safety Pants in your group. (After most of us left the
    store, they asked Bill how we managed to bear spray more people than bears). Bear spray, chairs, fishing
    rod, maps -- it was incredible.  John even bought an electronic copy of "Fishing for Dummies" -- keep
    reading for the outcome.  And for some future year they told us about Wind River Pack
    Goat Adventures (Erik Bailly), which rents pack goats that follow you up the trail carrying
    40 pounds of gear each.  That store was a true highlight of the trip.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day One</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Saturday, Aug 5 -- by 7am, Pinedale Airport was around 41 degrees; Steve was still naked while
  everyone else was in the hall with gear.  We got a quick breakfast and lunch-to-go at Heart and
  Soul Diner and we were driving by 8:20 on a clear, sunny, beautiful morning.  (Note for future years:
  the diner got busier by 8am; it's good we started early).
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  We reached the Scab Creek Trailhead at 9am: a pit toilet, no people but us, and 14 cars in the small lot plus some trailers in the stock
  area.  We broke the scale after weighing Alex at 41 lbs and Steve at 43.  We snapped our group photo and headed uphill and immediately left,
  which switched back to the east atop the ridge.
</p>

    The first two hours were non-eventful. There was decent shade, decent views behind us, but nothing noteworthy ahead -- just a decent uphill trail through
    forest, with some stock poop and flies.
  </p>

  <div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2023/2023-Wind-River/i-CFscn4j/0/MfhDbF3HQqVVM6rC6ktSXcw5SBH6KZSLrTWhRNcbh/4K/DSC01854-4K.jpg">

    <p class="regtext">
      And really, the next four hours were more of the same: generally uphill, not too steep, not much to see. The trail varied from fine to
      mucky and unattractive. We passed a few ponds, then
      ate lunch at Divide Lake -- campable (though not sure you'd want to) and the first easy water so far. 
      So far we had passed one group fishing, one camped at Divide, and one outbound.
