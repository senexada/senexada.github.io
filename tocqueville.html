When [the church] burries a Man, that action concerns me: All mankind is of
one Author, and is one volume.  No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main; if a Clod be washed away by the
Sea, Europe is the less. Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in
Mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

Book Review

Motivation

Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America is the most often quoted book about the United States and is "universally regarded as one of the most influential books ever written about America" [1,2].  Its author has been called the most famous visitor to the US as well as the most unusual member of the liberal pantheon [3,4].  All US presidents since Eisenhower have quoted him approvingly, and Harvard scholars Mansfield and Winthrop, who have written the definitive modern translation, declare the book to have the authority of a classic and call it "at once the best book ever written on democracy, and the best book ever written on America." [5]

Framing

Tocqueville and fellow French aristocrat Gustave de Beaumont traveled for nine months across American beginning in 1831, when Tocqueville was 25 years old.  They traveled as far as New Orleans, the Ohio Valley, and the upper Great Lakes (the then western fringe of civilization) in addition to visiting most of the coastal states.  After returning to France, Tocqueville published the work in two volumes, the first in 1835 and the second in 1840.  The modern translation is 676 pages of dense text.

The book is partly about Democracy, partly about America, and often about their unique combination, with a blend of practical observations, notable predictions, and philosophic theorizing.  Tocq was a contemporary of Smith, Marx, Carlyle, and appears well acquainted with descartes, montaigne, pascal, and many other philosophers, and to the educated reader there must be numerous clear referants. 

Like most great books, it is difficult to summarize, and any attempt would drain it of vitality.  This  review therefore explores a few dozen notable themes and topics. Covering fewer would be inadequate, covering more would be tedious, and over-generalizing would be unfair.   Many themes are frequently revisited, and thus a theme from the start may have citations from throughout.  Citations give the Volume, Book, Chapter, and page number in the Mansfield original edition: [I 2.5, 210] indicates Volume I, Part 2, Chapter 5, page 210.

Theme: Tocqueville’s framing

Tocqueville’s 12-page introduction frames the work.  He describes:
Equality of conditions as the “generative fact” and “central point” of all his observations
A 700-year trend of the spread of wealth and power that is providential and unstoppable
His own “sort of religious terror” at the sight of this revolution, as it destroys the lofty values of aristocracy; which he describes with phrases such as “advancing today amid the ruins it has made,” “degrading souls,” “coarseness and ignorance,” “ranks are confused”, “less brilliance,”
His simultaneous admiration of the revolution, such as its “energetic passions, generous sentiments, profound beliefs, and savage virtues” and more diffuse prosperity
The need for a new political science for this new world
His decision to observe democracy, discern its consequences, understand its goods and ills, hopes and fears, and render it profitable to men


If you examine what is happening in France every fifty years from the eleventh century on, at the end of each of these periods you cannot fail to perceive that a double revolution has operated on the state of society. The noble has fallen on the social ladder, and the commoner has risen; the one descends, the other climbs. Each half century brings them nearer, and soon they are going to touch.
[...]
The gradual development of equality of conditions is therefore a providential fact, and it has the principal characteristics of one; it is universal, it is enduring, each day it escapes human power; all events, like all men, serve its development.
[...]
One would be strangely mistaken to think that I wanted to make a panegyric; whoever reads this book will be well convinced that such was not my design; nor was my goal to advocate such a form of government in general; for I number among those who believe that there is almost never any absolute good in the laws; I have not even claimed to judge whether the social revolution, whose advance seems to me irresistible, was advantageous or fatal to humanity; I have accepted this revolution as an accomplished fact or one about to be accomplished; and among the peoples who have seen it operating in their midst, I have sought the one in whom it has attained the most complete and peaceful development, in order to discern clearly its natural consequences, and to perceive, if possible, the means of rendering it profitable to men. [I Introduction, 12-13]

Tocqueville re-emphasizes some of these themes sprinkled through his book, that men will not tolerate aristoc anymore (482) and arist has foreseen it (54).   in his Notice to Volume II:

One will perhaps be astonished that, while I am firmly of the opinion that the democratic revolution to which we are witness is an irresistible fact against which it would be neither desirable nor wise to struggle, in this book I often come to address such severe words to the democratic societies this revolution has created.  [...] I thought that many would take it upon themselves to announce the new goods that equality promises to men, but that few would dare to point out from afar the perils with which it threatens them.  It is therefore principally at those perils that I have directed my regard. [II Notice, 400]



And re-emphasizes them again in his final summary:

It is therefore never effortless for [men in democratic countries] to tear themselves away from their particular affairs to occupy themselves with common affairs; [...] my principal goal in writing this book has been to combat [such penchants of selfishness and atomism]. [II 4.3, 643]

I wished to expose to broad daylight the perils that equality brings to human independence because I firmly believe that these perils are the most formidable as well as the least foreseen of all those that the future holds. [II 4.7, 672]

[W]hat seems to me decadence is therefore progress in his [God’s] eyes [...] Equality is perhaps less elevated, but it is more just, and its justice makes for its greatness and its beauty.” [II 4.8, 674]




Origins

Theme: American Geography

Tocqueville begins with the favorable geography of America: a huge continent, rich in resources but devoid of civilization, isolated from other world powers, with temperate climate, the world’s best ports, and a superlative river valley.  Even the poor soil (of New England) worked to inhibit aristocracy by making anything but owner-operator uneconomical (30).

North America was still, properly speaking, an empty continent, a wilderness land, that awaited inhabitants [...] as if God had held it in reserve. [...] It presents, as in the first days of the creation, rivers whose source does not dry up, green and moist solitudes, boundless fields that the plowshare of the laborer has not yet turned. [I 2.9, 267-8]

There is no people in the world that can offer to commerce deeper, vaster, and safer ports than the Americans [I 2.10, 384]

Those coasts, so well prepared for commerce and industry, those rivers so deep, that inexhaustible Mississippi Valley, that continent as a whole, then appeared as the still-empty cradle of a great nation. [I 1.1, 27]

Though Tocqueville begins with and sometimes revisits geography, he does not descend to the modern vice of material reductionism. Later excerpts will show that he ascribes more importance to the settlers themselves -- their habits, opinions, and mores -- than the land (265), while also recognizing the interconnectedness of all factors, and the impact of geography on particular issues.  On reductionism he warns:

I am not unaware that several of my contemporaries have thought that peoples are never masters of themselves here below, and that they necessarily obey I do not know which insurmountable and unintelligent force born of previous events, the race, the soil, or the climate.  Those are false and cowardly doctrines that can never produce any but weak men and pusillanimous nations. [II, 4.8, 676]




Theme: American People, the Puritan origin
America was influenced by its spectacular geography, but even more by its “point of departure,” in Tocqueville’s words, from a core of high-quality Puritans, which Tocqueville calls “the seed of what is to follow and the key to almost the whole work” [I 1.2, 29].

He briefly mentions the north/south dichotomy, in particular the corroding influence of slavery and wealth-hunting, before highlighting the particular influence of the Puritans of New England, who “wanted to make *an idea* triumph” [I 1.2, 32].  These settlers were homogenous, equality reigned in fact: they spoke the same language, had centuries of experience under law and order, were educated, religious, virtuous, and motivated.  Their habits and opinions came to dominate the entire country.

The bond of language is perhaps the strongest and most lasting that can unite men. All the emigrants spoke the same tongue; they were all children of one and the same people.
[...]
One saw more notions of rights, more principles of true freedom spread among them than in most of the peoples in Europe. 
[...]
Education had been much increased in [the intellectual struggles of Christian religious quarrels]; the mind had received a more profound cultivation.  While they had been absorbed in speaking of religion, mores had become purer. [I 1.2, 29]

New England’s principles spread at first to the neighboring states; later, they gradually won out in the most distant, and in the end, if I can express myself so, they *penetrated* the entire confederation. They now exert their influence beyond its limits, over the whole American world. 
[...]
Proportionally, there was a greater mass of enlightenment spread among those men that within any European nation of our day. [...] It was not necessity that forced them to abandon their country; they left a social position they might regret and secure means of living; nor did they come to the New Worldin order to improve their situation or to increase their wealth; they tore themselves away from the sweetness of their native country to obey a purely intellectual need; in exposing themselves to the inevitable miseries of exile, they wanted to make *an idea* triumph. [I 1.2, 32]

Tocqueville sees early Puritan laws as particularly important in explaining “the great social enigma” of America, which is its unusual combination of religion and freedom.  He examines a sample code of law, remarking on both its nominal content and the real-life implementation.

Nothing is both more singular and more instructive than the legislation of this period; there above all one finds the password to the great social enigma that the United States presents to the world in our day.  

Among these memorials, we particularly distinguish, as one of the most characteristic, the code of laws that the little state of Connecticut passed in 1650. [I, 1.2, 37]

He spends several pages highlighting examples from that Connecticut code. “One never saw the death penalty laid down more profusely in the law,” including for blasphemy, sorcery, adultery, rape, and worshipping any other God but the Lord God, “or applied to fewer of the guilty” (he continues), the nominal penalties being softened by the enlightened spirit and mild mores of the inhabitants.

The penal laws are “preoccupied with the care of maintaining moral order” and thus “there is almost no sin that does not fall subject to the censure of the magistrate.”  Laws against, for instance, keeping company among unmarried people were often enforced.  Others, such as punishments for laziness and drunkenness or forced attendance at divine service, it is unspecified how vigorously they were enforced. [I 1.2, 38-39]

Simultaneously the laws greatly respected the spirit of freedom.

Beside this penal legislation, so strongly imprinted with the narrow spirit of sect and all the religious passions that persecution had exalted and that still fermented in the depth of souls, was placed and in a way connected to them a body of political laws which, drafted two hundred years ago, still seems to anticipate from very far the spirit of freedom in our age.
[...]
Intervention of the people in public affair, free voting of taxes, responsibility of the agents of power, individual freedom and judgement by jury were established there
[...]
In Connecticut the electoral body was composed, from the origin, of the universality of citizens [...] Citizens above sixteen years were obliged to bear arms
[I 1.2, 39]

Tocqueville observes that these two distinct elements, “the *spirit of religion* and the *spirit of freedom*, which “elsewhere have made war with each other,” America has marvelously combined in a symbiotic relationship. [I 1.2, 37, 43]

In America, it is religion that leads to enlightenment; it is the observance of divine laws that guides man to freedom. [...] Religion sees in civil freedom a noble exercise of the faculties of man [...] Freedom sees in religion the companion of its struggles and triumphs, the cradle of its infancy, the divine source of its rights. It considers religion as the safeguard of mores; and mores as the guarantee of laws and the pledge of its own duration. [I, 1.2, 43-44]


Theme: Govt proper: decentralized

Another early pattern in America is the radical decentralization.  Federalism constrained the tiny national government, which needed neither an army nor agents nor high taxes; townships performed most administration and tax collection; local sovereignty reigned, without the threats posed by a main city or a central source of news.  Tocqueville distinguishes between governmental centralization -- the idea of laws passed by a state legislature, which he deems reasonable and necessary -- and administrative centralization -- the idea that the actual It is attributed, again, to mostly the mores and habits of the people, but also the geography that was too dispersed for central administration.

[need more on governmental vs administrative centralization]

They are, in a word, twenty-four little sovereign nations, the sum of which forms the great body of the Union. [I 1.5, 56]

Thus it is true that the tax is voted by the legislature, but it is the township that apportions and collects it; the existence of a school is imposed, but the township builds it, pays for it, and directs it. [I 1.5, 63]

Generally, one can say that the salient characteristic of public administration in the United States is to be enormously decentralized. [I 1.5, 79]

I saw the evils of the state imputed to an infinite variety of causes, but never to freedom of the township. [I 1.5, 92]

Congress regulates the principal actions of social existence; every detail of it is abandoned to provincial legislation [I 1.8, 153]

Furthermore, by combining a series of footnotes, we may conclude that the sum of spending at the national, state, and county level probably amounted to about half a percent of the salary of the lowest level government clerk. [I, 2.5, 207 footnote 11] [1, 2.5, 204 footnote 9]
Tocqueville used one year of figures from Pennsylvania
He was unable to obtain township figures, but obtained county, state, and federal
Per capita annual taxes were approx 4 francs county, 4 state, and 13 federal
The income of the lowest level Treasury Dept clerk was 5420 francs per year
Thus 21 / 5240 is approximately 0.4%


(origins // the govt proper // the people // democ vs arist )

Theme: govt proper: the judiciary

Tocqueville explains the government proper of the United States, which is remarkably little changed from the 1830s to a modern-day civics class. His level of detail approaches tedious, yet contains some atypical observation or analysis.

Tocqueville describes our judicial system as unique in the world due to the ability for judges to “found their rulings on the *Constitution* rather than on the *laws*.” [I 1.6, 93,95].  

When one invokes a law before the courts of the United States that the judge deems contrary to the Constitution, he can therefore refuse to apply it.  This power is the only one that is particular to the American magistrate, but a great political influence flows from it.
[...]
Americans have therefore entrusted an immense political power to their courts; but in obliging them to attack the laws only by judicial means, they have much diminished the dangers of this power [...] [which] forms one of the most powerful barriers that has ever been raised against the tyranny of political assemblies. [I, 1.6, 96-7]

When Tocqueville says “judicial means,” he means that judges can only bind (a) the interested parties (b) in a specific dispute that (c) is brought before him. He cannot choose rulings nor generally attack laws, though he later concedes that everything eventually is brought before the courts: “there is almost no political question in the United States that is not resolved sooner or later into a judicial question.” [I, 2.8, 257]

Tocqueville was particularly impressed, perhaps due to the excesses of French politics, that political trials cannot result in jail time [I, 1.7, 101]. The mildness of American consequence (removal of office, but no criminal penalty) makes Americans more likely to exercise removal to curb excess.  On the other hand, he predicts that an increase in political judgements will indicate the start of degeneration of the republic [I, 1.7, 104].
. 
The Supreme Court thus has immense power, that is dangerous, but a symptom of our system of government.

When, after having examined in detail the organization of the Supreme Court, one comes to consider in sum the prerogatives that have been given it, one discovers without difficulty that a more immense judicial power has never been constituted in any people.
[...]
The original cause of the danger is not in the constitution of the tribunal, but in the very nature of federal governments. We have seen that nowhere is it more necessary to constitute the judicial power strongly than in confederated peoples, because nowhere are the individual existences that can struggle against the social body greater and in a better state to resist the use of the material force of government.   [I, 1.8, 142]  [how should I include? This is a weird summary that doesn’t fit my understanding of the prior pages]

In other observations, he notes that lawyers have immense political influence that counteracts the “lapses of democracy” due to their aristocratic nature.

Men who have made the laws their special study have drawn from their work the habits of order, a certain taste for forms, a sort of instinctive lover for the regular sequence of ideas, which naturally render them strongly opposed to the revolutionary spirit and unreflective passions of democracy. [...] Hidden at the bottom of the souls of lawyers one therefore finds a part of the tastes and habits of aristocracy. [I, 2.8, 252]

If one asked me where I place the American aristocracy, I would respond without hesitation that it is not among the rich, who have no common bond that brings them together.  The American aristocracy is at the attorneys’ bar and on the judges’ bench. 
The more one reflects on what takes place in the United States, the more one feels convinced that the body of lawyers forms the most powerful and so to speak the lone counterweight to democracy in this country. [I, 2.8, 256]

Finally, he makes some colorful comments on the nature of the precedent-based legal system, so different from his native France.

The English and the Americans have preserved the legislation of precedents; that is to say, they continue to draw from the opinions and legal decisions of their fathers the opinions that they will hold in matters of law and the decisions that they will take.
[...]
The English or the American lawyer inquires into what has been done, the French lawyer into what one ought to wish to do; the one wants rulings, the other reasons.  
When you listen to an English or an American lawyer, you are surprised to see him cite teh opinion of others so often and to hear him speak so little of his own, whereas the contrary happens among us.
[...]
Our written laws are often difficult to understand, but each man can read them; there is nothing, on the contrary, more obscure for the vulgar and less within his reach than legislation founded on precedents. [...] The French lawyer is only a learned man; but the English or American man of law resembles in a way the priests of Egypt; like them, he is the lone interpreter of an occult science. [I, 2.8, 255]

And he notes the universal jury participation by citizens, and the use of juries in both criminal and civil affairs, which serves as a school of civics that raises the minds of men.

In England, the jury is recruited from the aristocratic portion of the nation. [...] In the United States, the same system is applied to the entire people.  Each American is elector, eligible [for office], and juror.  The system of the jury, as it is understood in America, appears to me as direct and as extreme a consequence of the dogma of the sovereignty of the people as universal suffrage.  These are two equally powerful means of making the majority reign.
[...]
The jury, and above all the civil jury, serves to give to the minds of all citizens a part of the habits of mind of the judge; and these habits are precisely those that best prepare the people to be free. [...]
It teaches men the practice of equity. Each, in judging his neighbor, thinks that he could be judged in his turn. That is above all true of the jury in a civil matter; there is almost no one who fears being the object of a criminal prosecution one day; but everyone can have a lawsuit.
[...]
It vests each citizen with a sort of magistracy; it makes all feel that they have duties toward society to fulfill and that they enter into its government. In forcing men to occupy themselves with something other than their own affairs, it combats individual selfishness, which is like the blight of societies.
The jury serves incredibly to form the judgement and to augment the natural enlightenment of the people.  There, in my opinion, is its greatest advantage. One ought to consider it as a school, free of charge and always open, where each juror comes to be instructed in his rights, where he enters into daily communication with the most instructed and most enlightened members of the elevated classes, where the laws are taught to him in a practical manner and are put within reach of his intelligence by the efforts of the attorneys, the advice of the judge, and the very passions of the parties.  I think that the practical intelligence and good political sense of the Americans must principally be attributed to the long use that they have made of the jury in civil matters. [I, 2.8, 261-262]



Theme: govt proper: the constitution

Tocqueville describes the constitution as the product of an assembly of “the finest minds and the noblest characters that had ever appeared in the New World,” presided by George Washington [I, 1.8, 107].  Tocqueville discusses its enumerated powers and specifically recommends the Federalist Papers as a “a fine book that, though special to America, ought to be familiar to statesmen of every country.” [I 1.8 footnote, 108] 

The prerogatives of the federal government were therefore carefully defined, and it was declared that everything that was not comprised in that definition returned to the prerogatives of the state governments.  [I, 1.8, 107-108]

He recognizes the disproportionate power of the senate, without notable commentary.  [I 1.8, 112] He is particularly impressed by the amendability of our Constitution, which he contrasts with France, which cannot be amended (presumably, though not mentioned, a cause of their frequent revolutions), and Britain, which can amend so easily that it is little more than an ordinary law.

In France, the constitution is an immutable work, or supposed to be so. No power can change anything in it; such is the received theory.
In England, they recognize in Parliament the right to modify the constitution. In England, the constitution can therefore change constantly, or rather it does not exist.  Parliament is at the same time the legislative body and the constituting body. 
In America, political theories are simpler and more rational.
An American constitution is not supposed to be immutable as in France; it cannot be modified by the ordinary powers of society as in England. [I, 1.6, 95]
 
Some notable changes since Tocqueville’s day is that the president then could fire all federal employees and states could not alter private contracts. [I, 1.8, 122 & 138]




Theme: govt proper: politics & politicians


Tocqueville is mostly critical of the state of politicians and parties in America.  He declares that since the early Federalists there have been no great parties nor great men.  He observes representatives to be vulgar, Senators to be respectable due to indirect election, and that in general only vulgar, debased men are attracted to democratic leadership.  

America has had great parties; today they no longer exist: it has gained much in happiness, but not in morality. [...]
The party that wanted to restrict popular power sought above all to make its doctrines apply to the Constitution of the Union, by which it earned the name *federal*.
The other, which claimed to be the exclusive lover of freedom, took the title *republican* [editor’s footnote: Repulican Democrats, today’s Democrat party].
America is the land of democracy. The Federalists were therefore always in a minority; but they counted in their ranks almost all the great men the War of Independence had given birth to, and their moral power was very extensive.  [I, 2.2, 167-8]

While the natural instincts of democracy bring the people to keep distinguished men away from power, an instinct no less strong brings the latter to distance themselves from a political career, in which it is so difficult for them to remain completely themselves and to advance without debasing themselves. This thought is very naively expressed by Chancellor Kent. The celebrated author I speak of, after having given great eulogies to the portion of the Constitution that accords the nomination of judges to the executive power, adds: “It is probable, in fact, that the most appropriate men to fill these places would have too much reserve in their manners and too much severity in their principles ever to be able to gather the majority of votes at an election that rested on universal suffrage.” (Kent’s Commentaries, Vol 1) That was printed in America in the year 1830 without contradiction.
It has demonstrated to me that those who regard universal suffrage as a guarantee of the goodness of choices make a complete illusion for themselves. Universal suffrage has other advantages, but not that one. [I, 2.5, 189-190]

When you enter the House of Representatives in Washington, you feel yourself struck by the vulgar aspect of this great assembly.  Often the eye seeks in vain for a celebrated man within it. [...] In a country where instruction is almost universally widespread, it is said that the people’s representatives do not always know how to write correctly.
Two steps away is the chamber of the Senate, whose narrow precincts enclose a large portion of the celebrities of America. [...] All the words that issue from this assembly would do honor to the greatest parliamentary debates of Europe.
Whence this peculiar contrast? [...] Why are so many vulgar elements gathered in the first assembly when the second seems to have the monopoly on talents and enlightenment? [...] I see only a single fact that explains it: the election that produces the House of Representatives is direct; that from which the Senate emanates is subject to two stages.  [I, 2.5, 191-2]

Elaborating on his distaste for direct election, and the benefits of layers of indirection, when he later discusses his prediction that the electoral college will add yet another layer of indirection.
[need source!]

He further observes that since the founding, which was illuminated by Federalist principles, the Republican Democrats (today’s Democrats) had “advanced from conquest to conquest, and has taken possession of the society as a whole.” [I, 2.2, 168]

He notes that voting is universal except for “slaves, domestics, and indigents nourished by the townships.”  [I, 2.6, 230]  

He printed “that admirable letter” by George Washington that set a tone of isolation that allowed the federal govt to remain small and army-less. [I, 2.5, 217]


Theme: People: the good

Tocqueville is full of penetrating observations of American people themselves.

Later excerpts will explore regional and racial differences. His most general statements depict the broad homogeneity that makes such a large region governable. 

One therefore encounters an immense multitude of individuals who have nearly the same number of notions in matters of religion, of history, of science, of political economy, of legislation, of government. [I, 1.3, 51]

There is one fact that admirably facilitates federal government in the United States.  The different states have not only nearly the same interests, the same origin, the same language, but even the same degree of civilization, which almost always renders agreement between them an easy thing. I do not know if there is a small European nation that does not present an aspect less homogeneous in its different parts than the American people, whose territory is as great as half of Europe.
From the state of Maine to the state of Georgia one counts around four hundred leagues. Nevertheless, less difference exists between the civilization of Maine and that of Georgia than between the civilization of Normandy and that of Brittany.  Maine and Georgia, placed at two ends of a vast empire, therefore naturally find more real opportunities to form a conderederation than Normandy and Brittany, which are separated only by a stream.  [I, 1.8, 158-9]

Tocqueville says many praiseworthy things about the American people.  They are peaceful, without class hatreds, and the rich classes mingle with all.

In the United States there is no religious hatred because religion is universally respected and no sect is dominant; there is no class hatred because the people are everything and no one yet dares to struggle with them; finally, there are no public miseries to exploit because the material state of the country offers such an immense scope for industry that it is enough to leave man to himself for him to do prodigies. [I, 2.2, 169]

In the United States, the most opulent citizens take much care not to isolate themselves from the people; on the contrary, they constantly come close to them, they gladly listen to them and speak to them every day.  They know that the rich in democracies always need the poor, and that in democratic times one ties the poor to oneself more by manners than by benefits.  [II, 2.4, 487]

The Americans are full of commercial passion that promotes order and honesty, and are constantly uniting for commerce, religion, and other public goods.

The passions that agitate the Americans most profoundly are commercial passions and not political passions, or rather, they carry the habits of trade into politics. They love order, without which affairs cannot prosper, and they particularly prize regularity of mores, on which good houses [of business] are founded. [I, 2.9, 273]

Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and very small; Americans use associations to give fetes, to found seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons, schools.  Finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate.  Everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an association in the United States.  [II, 2.5, 489]

Americans will rule the oceans, he predicts, due to their boldness that borders on reckless.

United States vessels fill the ports of Le Havre and Liverpool. One sees only a few English or French bottoms in the port of New York.
Thus not only does the American trader brave competition in his own soil, but he also does combat with foreigners advantageously on theirs.
This is readily explained: of all the vessels in the world, United States ships cross the seas most cheaply. [...]  American vessels are almost as dear to build as ours; they are not better constructed and generally do not last as long.  The wages of the American seaman are higher than those of the European seaman [...] How is it, therefore, that Americans navigate more cheaply than we do? [...]
The European navigator ventures on the seas only with prudence; he departs only when the weather invites him to; if an unforeseen accident comes upon him, he enters into port at night, he furls a part of his sails, and when he sees the ocean whiten at the approach of land, he slows his course and examines the sun.
The American neglects these precautions and braves these dangers. He departs while the tempest still roars; at night as in day he opens all his sails to the wind; while on teh go, he repairs his ship, worn down by teh storm, and when he finally approaches the end of his course, he continues to fly toward the shore as if he already perceived the port.
The American is often shipwrecked; but there is no navigator who crosses the seas as rapidly as he does. Doing the same things as another in less time, he can do them at less expense.  [I, 2.10, 385-6]

And Tocqueville earnestly paints the American mythos of “go west”:  the enlightened common man taming the wilderness with bible and hatchet, the pioneer cabins with books of Shakespeare, the women born in mansions yet resolutely enduring the leaky hut.

It is therefore Americans who, abandoning the place of their birth daily, go to create vast domains in the distance. [...] They were told that fortune is to be found somewhere toward the west, and they go off in haste to meet it. [I, 2.9, 268-9]

If [the outside observer] pays attention only to the learned, he will be astonished at their small number; if he counts the ignorant, the American people will seem to him the most enlightened people on earth. [...]
Scarcely arrived at a place that will serve as a refuge for him, the pioneer hastily fells some trees and raises a cabin under the leaves.  The traveler who approaches them toward evening perceives from afar the flame of the hearth glittering through the walls; and at night, if the wind comes up, he hears the roof of foliage rustling in the midst of the trees of the forest.  Who would not believe that this poor cottage serves as a refuge for coarseness and ignorance?  Yet one must not establish any retaliation between the pioneer and the place that serves as his refuge.  All is primitive and savage around him, but he is so to speak the result of eighteen centuries of work and experience.  He wears the same clothing of the towns, he speaks their language; he knows the past, is curious about the future, argues about the present; he is a very civilized man who, for a time, submits to living in the middle of the woods, and who plunges into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, a hatchet, and newspapers. [I, 2.9, 289-290]

There is scarcely a pioneer’s cabin where one does not encounter some odd volume of Shakespeare.  I recall having read the feudal drama of *Henry V* for the first time in a log-house. [II, 1.12, 445]

I often met young women at the utmost limits of the wilderness who, after having been raised in the midst of all the delicacies of the great cities of New England, had passed almost without transition from the rich dwellings of their parents to leaky huts in the middle of a forest. Fever, solitude, and tedium had not broken the springs of their courage. Their features seemed altered and faded, but their look was firm. They appeared at once sad and resolute.  [II, 2.10, 567]

Around this withered debris wheat, offshoots of oaks, plants of all kinds, herbs of every nature grow pell-mell and get larger together on an unruly and half-wild soil. In the midst of this vigorous and varied vegetation rises the house of the pioneer or, as one calls it in that country, the log-house.  This rustic dwelling, like the field that surrounds it, tells of a new and hasty work; its length does not appear to us to exceed thirty feet, its height fifteen; its walls as well as the roof are formed of unhewn tree trunks between which moss and earth have been placed to prevent the cold and rain from penetrating inside. [...]
There is only a single window from which a muslin curtain hangs; in a hearth of trodden earth a great fire crackles that lights the whole inside of the building; above this hearth one perceives a fine scratched rifle, a deerskin, some eagle feathers; to the right of the chimney a map of the United States is spread out, which the wind lifts and agitates as it gets through the chinks in the wall; near to it on the shelf formed of a badly hewn board a few volumes have been placed; I notice on it the Bible, the first six cantos of Milton, and two plays of Shakespeare [...]
The master of this dwelling has the angular features and slender limbs that distinguish the inhabitant of New England; it is evident that this man was not born in the solitudes where we encounter him: his physical constitution is enough to tell that his first years were passed in the heart of an intellectual society and that he belongs to the restive, reasoning, and adventurous race that does coldly what only the ardor of the passions explains, and that submits for a time to a wild life in order better to vanquish and civilize the wilderness. [...]
At the other end of the hearth a woman is seated who cradles a young child on her knees; without interrupting herself she makes a signal to us with her head. Like the pioneer, this woman is in the flower of age, her appearance seems superior to her condition, her dress even announces a taste for finery still barely extinguished; but her delicate limbs appear diminished, her features are tired, her eye is mild and grave; one sees spread over her whole face a religious resignation, a profound peace of the passions, and a natural and tranquil firmness that confronts all the evils of life without fearing them or braving them.  
Her children press around her; they are full of health, turbulence, and energy; they are true sons of the wilderness; from time to time, their mother casts glances full of melancholy and joy at them; to see their strength and her weakness one would say that she has exhausted herself in giving them life and that she does not regret what they have cost her.
The house inhabited by the emigrants has neither interior partition nor attic. In the lone apartment that it contains the entire family comes to seek refuge at night. This dwelling forms, by itself, almost a little world; it is the ark of civilization lost in the middle of an ocean of foliage. A hundred steps further on, the eternal forest extends its shadow around it, and the solitude begins again. [II, 3.10 note XX, 700]





Theme: People: the bad

Tocqueville also applied his penetrating observation to the regrettable aspects of the American people.  Besides slavery, which fills an entire section below, he deems Americans to be obsessed with money and materialism.

Indeed, I do not know a country where the love of money holds a larger place in the heart of man [I, 1.3, 50]

A thousand particular causes, of which I could make only the principal ones known, must have concentrated the American mind in a singular manner on caring for purely material things.  Their passions, needs, education, circumstances -- all in fact seem to cooperate in making the inhabitant of the United States incline toward the earth.  Religion alone, from time to time, makes him raise passing, distracted glances toward Heaven. [II, 1.9, 430]

America lacks a proper literature, with “towns of the third order in Europe that publish more literary works” than the entire Union. [II, 1.13, 446] [I, 2.9, 288]  Its poetry is incoherent and bizarre. 

I have often remarked that Americans, who generally treat affairs in a clear and dry language deprived of every ornament, whose extreme simplicity is often vulgar, willingly run to bombast when they want to enter into poetic style. Then they show themselves relentlessly pompous from one end of the speech to the other, and to see them thus squander images at eerie turn one would believe that they have never said anything simply. [...]
I fear that the works of democratic poets will often offer immense and incoherent images, overloaded depictions, and bizarre composites, and that the fantastic beings issuing from their minds will sometimes make one long for the real world.  [II, 1.18, 465-6]

Regarding social graces, the American displays an irritable patriotism. He is insatiable for praise and ill-aware of social conventions.

The American, taking part in all that is done in this country, believes himself interested in defending all that is criticized there; for not only is his country then attacked, he himself is: thus one see his national pride have recourse to all the artifices and descend to all the puerilities of individual vanity.
There is nothing more annoying in the habits of life than this irritable patriotism of the Americans. [I, 2.6, 227]
Americans, in their relations with foreigners, appear impatient at the least censure and insatiable for praise. The slimmest eulogy is agreeable to them and the greatest is rarely enough to satisfy them; they pester you at every moment to get you to praise them; and if you resist their entreaties, they praise themselves. [...] One cannot imagine a more disagreeable and talkative patriotism. [II, 3.16, 585]

I remarked many times in the United States that it is not an easy thing to make a man understand that his presence is unwelcome. To come to that, roundabout ways do not always suffice. [II, 3.3, 542]

And despite the Americans’ practical and commercial temerity, in the realm of ideas the Americans have forfeited their independence of mind to the despotism of the majority.

I do not know any country where, in general, less independence of mind and genuine freedom of discussion reign than in America. [...] 
In America the majority draws a formidable circle around thought. Inside those limits, the writer is free; but unhappiness awaits him if he dares to leave them. It is not that he has to fear an auto-da-fe, but he is the butt of mortifications of all kinds and of persecutions every day.  A political career is closed to him: he has offended the only power that has the capacity to open it up.  Everything is refused him, even glory. [...]
Chains and executioners are the coarse instruments that tyranny formerly employed; but in our day civilization has perfected even despotism itself, which seemed, indeed to have nothing more to learn. [...] in democratic republics, tyranny does not proceed [against the body]; it leave the body and goes straight for the soul.  The master no longer says to it: You shall think as I do or you shall die; he says: You are free not to think as I do; your life, your goods, everything remains to you; but from this day on, you are a stranger among us. [...] You shall remain among men, but you shall lose your rights of humanity. [I, 2.7, 244-5]

If America has not yet had great writers, we ought not to seek the reasons for this elsewhere: no literary genius exists without freedom of mind, and there is no freedom of mind in America.
The Inquisition could never prevent books contrary to the religion of the greatest number from circulating in Spain. The empire of the majority does better in the United States: it has taken away even the thought of publishing them.  [I, 2.7, 245]

Among the immense crowd that flocks to a political career in the United States, I have seen few men indeed who show that virile candor, that manly independence of thought, that often distinguished Americans in previous time and that, everywhere it is found, forms the salient feature of great characters.  [...]
If these lines ever come to America, I am sure of two things: first, that readers will all raise their voices to condemn me; second, that many among them will absolve me at the bottom of their consciences. [I, 2.7, 247]



Theme: people: contrast old & new world with America

Sprinkled through the work are contrasts of Americans with both the old world and with other new world countries.

Tocqueville consistently ascribes success to the mores of a people, more than material causes, documents, or formalities.  He first describes New England as making better choices than anywhere else:

In New England, where education and freedom are the children of morality and religion; where society, already old and long established, has been able to form maxims and habits, the people, at the same time that they escape all the superiorities that wealth and birth have ever created among men, have been habituated to respect intellectual and moral superiorities and to submit to them without displeasure: thus one sees that democracy in New England makes better choices than everywhere else. [I, 2.5, 191]

He then continues to describe the United States’s outcome to exceed that of the rest of the new rold.  Mexico, with nearly an identical constitution, but worse outcome.

The inhabitants of Mexico, wishing to establish a federal system, took as a model and copied almost entirely the federal constitution of the Anglo-Americans, their neighbors [Tocqeville footnote: see the Mexican constitution of 1824].  But in transporting the letter of the law to themselves, they could not at the same time transport the spirit that enlivened it. One therefore sees them constantly embarrassed amid the wheels of their double government. [...]Mexico is still now incessantly carried along from anarchy to military despotism, and from military despotism to anarchy. [I, 1.8, 156]

South America had great natural wealth and no enemies, but has been a disaster.

But nature had isolated the Spanish of South America in the same manner [as the Anglos in North America], and that isolation did not prevent them from keeping armies. They made war among themselves when foreigners were lacking.  It is only Anglo-American democracy that, up to the present, has been able to maintain itself in peace. 
[...]
In what portion of the world does one encounter wilderness more fertile, greater rivers, wealth more intact and more inexhaustible than in South America? Nevertheless, South America cannot support democracy.  If, for peoples to be happy, it were enough to have been placed in a corner of the universe and to be able to spread at will over uninhabited lands, the Spanish of southern America would not have to complain of their lot.  And if they did not enjoy the same happiness as inhabitants of the United States, they ought at least to have made themselves envied by the peoples of Europe.  There are nevertheless no nations of earth more miserable than those of South America.
[...]

Does he ascribe the new world differences to laws or resources? No, to the mores of the inhabitants, which he defines as “the whole moral and intellectual state of a people.” [I, 2.9, 275]

Physical causes therefore do not influence the destiny of nations as much as one supposes.
[...]
Mexico, which is as happily situated as the Anglo-American Union, has appropriated these same laws, and it has not been able to become habituated to the government of democracy.  There is therefore a reason independent of physical causes and laws that enables democracy to govern the United States. 
[...]
I am convinced that the happiest situation and the best laws cannot maintain a constitution despite mores, whereas the latter turn even the most unfavorable positions and the worst laws to good account.  The importance of mores is a common truth to which study and experience constantly lead back.  It seems to me that I have it placed in my mind as a central point; I perceive it at the end of all my ideas.
I have only one more word to say on this subject.
If, in the course of this work, I have not succeeded in making the reader feel teh importance that I attribute to the practical experience of the Americans, to their habits, to their opinions -- in a word, to their mores -- in the maintenance of their laws, I have missed the principal goal that I proposed for myself in writing it. [I, 2.9, 294-5]

In comparing the United States to the old world, Tocqueville offers amusing contrasts, from the superficial -- such as the lack of ceremonial uniforms among government officials -- to deep differences of outlook and personality.  [I, 2.5, 194]  The Americans, compared to Europeans, are restive, greedy, independent, and impelled to commerce.

In Europe we habitually regard restiveness of mind, immoderate desire for wealth, extreme love of independence as great social dangers.  It is precisely all these things that guarantee a long and peaceful future to the American republics. Without these restive passions, the population would be concentrated around certain places and would, as among us, soon feel needs difficult to satisfy.  What a happy country is the New World, where man’s vices are almost as useful to society as his virtues! [I, 2.9, 272]

I have shown how Americans are unceasingly impelled toward commerce and industry. Their origin, their social state, the political institutions, the very place that they inhabit, carry them irresistibly in this direction.  They therefore presently form an almost exclusively industrial and commercial association, placed in the bosom of a new and immense country whose exploitation is its principal object.  Such is the characteristic feature that in our day most particularly distinguishes the American people from all others. [II, 3.18, 593]

While the European values centralization, government regulation, and a public sinecure, the American prizes voluntary associations and, other than basic law and order, to be left alone.

The first time I heard it said in the United States that a hundred thousand men publicly engaged not to make use of strong liquors, the thing appeared to me more amusing than serious, and at first I did not see well why such temperate citizens were not content to drink water within their families. [...] It is to be believed that if those hundred thousand men had lived in France, each of them would have addressed himself individually to the government, begging it to oversee the cabarets all over teh realm. [II, 2.5, 492]

In the united States, as soon as a citizen has some enlightenment and some resources, he seeks to enrich himself in commerce and industry, or better, he buys a field covered with forests and makes himself a pioneer.  All that he demands of the state is that it not come to trouble him in his labors, and that it assure him the fruits of them.
Among the European peoples, when a man begins to feel his strength and to extend his desires, teh first idea that presents itself to him is to obtain a public post. [II, 3.20, 604-5]

He compares the treatment of women. America women are freer when young, more constrained when married, intellectually respected, and of the very highest quality.  He does not tie these features into a linear chain of causality; he simply provides a loosely coupled set of observations.

There have never been free societies without mores, and as I said in the first part of this work, it is woman who make mores. Therefore, all that influences the condition of women, their habits, and their opinions has great political interest in my eyes.
[...]
In the United States, the doctrines of Protestantism come to combine with a very free constitution and a very democratic social state; and nowhere is the girl more promptly or more completely left to herself.
Long before the young American woman has attained the age of puberty, one begins to free her little by little from maternal tutelage; before she has entirely left childhood she already thinks for herself, speaks freely, and acts alone; the great picture of the world is constantly exposed before her; far from seeking to conceal teh view of it from her, they uncover more and more of it to her regard every day and teach her to consider it with a firm and tranquil eye. [...]
In America the independence of woman is irretrievably lost with the bounds of marriage.  If the girl is less constrained [in America] than everywhere else, the wife submits to stricter obligations.  The one makes of the paternal home a place of freedom and pleasure, the other lives in her husband’s dwelling as in a cloister. 
These two so different states are perhaps not so contrary as is supposed, and it is natural that Americans pass through the one to arrive at the other.
[...]
The Americans form at once a Puritan notation and a commercial people; their religious beliefs as well as their industrial habits therefore bring them to exact from woman a self-abnegation and a continual sacrifice of her pleases to her business that is rare to demand of her in Europe.  Thus an inexorable public opinion reigns in the United States that carefully confines woman within the small circle of interests and domestic duties, and forbids her to leave it. [II, 3.10, 565-6]
There are people in Europe who, confusing the diverse attributes of the sexes, intend to make man and woman into beings not only equal, but alike. They give both the same functions, impose teh same duties on them, and accord them the same rights; they mix them in all things  -- labors, pleasure, affairs.  One can easily conceive that in thus striving to equalize one sex with the other, one degrades them both; and that from this coarse mixture of nature’s works, only weak men and disreputable women can ever emerge.
This is not the way the Americans have understood the kind of democratic equality that can be established between woman and man. They have thought that since nature had established such great variation between the physical and moral constitution of man and that of woman, its clearly indicated goal was to give a diverse employment to their different faculties; and they have judged that progress did not consist in making two unlike beings do nearly the same things, but in etting each of them to acquit its task as well as possible. Americans have applied to the two sexes teh great principle of political economy that dominates industry in our day.  They have carefully divided the functions of man and woman in order that the great social work be better done. [...]
Americans do not believe that man and woman have the duty or the right to do the same things, but they show the same esteem for the role of each of them, and they consider them as beings whose value is equal although their destiny differs. They do not give teh same form or the same employment to the courage of woman as to that of man, but they never doubt her courage;  and if they deem that man and his mate should not always employ the intelligence and reason in teh same manner, they at least judge that the reason of one is as sure as that of the other, and her intelligence as clear.
Americans, who have allowed the inferiority of woman to subsist in society, have therefore elevated her with all their power to the level of man in the intellectual and moral world; and in this they appear to me to have admirably understood the true notino of democratic progress.
As for me, I shall not hesitate to say it: although in the United States teh woman scarcely leaves the domestic circle and is in certain respects very dependent within it, nowhere does her position seem higher to me; and now that I approach the end of this book where I have shown so many considerable things done by Americans, if one asked me to what do I think one must principally attribute the singular prosperity and growing force of this people, I would answer that it is to teh superiority of its women.  [II, 3.12, 573-6]


Finally, he relates the behavior of travelers abroad: the American has a brotherhood with all his countrymen, the European only with countrymen of hte same social class.

In a foreign country, two Americans are friends right away for teh sole reason that they are Americans.  There is no prejudice that repels them, and the community of their native country attracts them.  For two Englishmen, the same blood is not enough: the same rank must bring them together. [II, 3.2, 541]

He notes that Christianity is dying in Europe, while maintaining a somewhat unconventional vigor in the United States.

The philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the gradual weakening of beliefs in an altogether simple fashion. Religious zeal, they said, will be extinguished as freedom and enlightenment increase.  It is unfortunate that the facts do not accord with this theory. [...]
On my arrival in the United States it was the religious aspect of the country that first struck my eye. A

[4] The Economist.  “HE IS the most unusual member of the liberal pantheon. Liberalism has usually been at its most vigorous among the Anglo-American middle classes. By contrast, Alexis de Tocqueville was a proud member of the French aristocracy. Liberalism tends to be marinated in optimism to such an extent that it sometimes shades into naivety. Tocqueville believed that liberal optimism needs to be served with a side-order of pessimism.” https://www.economist.com/schools-brief/2018/08/09/de-tocqueville-and-the-french-exception
