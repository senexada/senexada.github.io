* Interesting forum post about middle age sprint training --
  [link][sprint-forum]
  > I faffed about in my early 50s with a botched sprinting plan. It wasn't until I met other sprinters and sprint coaches that my sprinting significantly improved.

  > There are different models and approaches to competitive sprinting, muddied by sprint interval training models for sports conditioning purposes, for fat loss, metabolic stuff etc And yes it is confusing....

  > So to start. If you look out to the horizon and ponder over 'should I rest for 3 minutes or 5'? then rest for at least 5. If you then quiz yourself over 4 times a week or twice, go for twice and evaluate keeping the option of once a week open. In other words, less is more.

  > It's not dissimilar to other strength training and think of sprinting as exactly that, strength training. Again, here you can focus on energetics, rest periods, force production etc and all of it is governed by your form....

  > For example. Run a 100m 6 times with at least 10 minutes rest. Not at maximum but 80-85%.
This is very SF vernacular and very important....you finish strongly and your first rep is as good as your last rep.

  > Now. It is very easy for anyone with a running/athletic base to run 6x100m. Without training though, the 4th set will get ugly and you will chase those remaining sets....and this will happen....

  > You will break at the waist, your arse will go back, arms will flail and your neck will stick out and you will push the effort. If any of those signs appear you should stop and go home. And so you stop at set 4.....you are not strong enough and you need to regress. (Also, you will be slow).

  > This is where sprinting splits from, er, sprinting.....where the emphasis is on metabolic rather than speed, if that is a somewhat crap differential, as there is some crossover at some point. But don't concern yourself with that, it's distracting....an analogy here with kb swinging, 10x10 with impeccable form v whacking out the reps in a ball of sweat where form goes, injury risk is elevated and you get through it but don't really progress. It's ok to really struggle through during a test or competition but not in general training...right?

  > So, a progression...
  > 6x50. Add 10m a week. The goal is 6x100. Everything is governed by form. Rest is 1 minute for every 10m. This is conservative, you could do less BUT if you do and your form goes then you are not resting enough and or doing too much..
  > (This is a Charlie Francis model of rest for speed. It's a minimum usually reserved to max velocity but applies to speed development too).

  > You could say 'rest as needed'. For you, go for full rest if you've never done it before. As you are at 80-85 - a comfortable fast output - you could argue for less rest. And yes, if strong enough, experienced enough with good form, sure. But, well....you're not, yet. So keep the rests longer. That means of course that 6x100 with warm ups, drills, cool down is at least 90 minutes.. Hope for good weather.

  > 6x50
  > 6x60
  > 6x70
  > 6x80
  > 6x90
  > 6x100

  > Or begin at 30, to be safer/cautious. Why 100?

  > This is from an 18 week speed training programme for 50 something training for a short 60m competition or a handicap 110/100 (80m thereabouts depending on handicap).

  > Get to 6x100 before considering top speed. Twice a week. From there, intensity increases and volume decreases for another 6 weeks before volume reduces again as intensity is at maximum.

  > For the first few weeks, yeah do other things if you want/need. I can say with great confidence that you need to take care approaching higher volumes and you may need to streamline and monitor recovery more closely than the earlier weeks.

  > This will give you a good base. Other models are available of course. You may need longer than 6 weeks, or may not even want to get to 6x100. But don't progress by ticking the distances, do them strongly and well. If you get to 6x70 and you start failing with the 80s, stay at 70s for a bit longer. Or at 50, wherever you are at and build on it.

  > This works. It's what I do and its from a sprint coach devised specifically for the 50+ population. I'm 59. I've used this since 52/53 or so. You could argue it's cautious because it is. But, 6x100m with good form is the hardest part of the 18 weeks. So it's not as easy as it would appear. So be cautious.

  > Your energetic system will develop alongside tissue preparation for the higher forces present with max velocity training and it is excellent preparation. Sprint on grass if possible. Don't force acceleration, gradually build into it. Get into a nice upright posture, hold that position and relax. VERY IMPORTANT: decelerate slowly. NO sudden stops, so leave plenty of room to run into. You have long rests so no need to rush slowing down! Get some mobility drills to work on during the rests and relax. Do fast and loose drills, or similar or whatever if you have specific needs to work on. And, relax.

### Calibre for converting ebook formats

This was a huge pain in the ass. 40+ minutes. Most of the time is spent figuring it out and configuring.
Once installed, a second ebook should be faster.

1) Buy book on kobo.com -- note: do not login with google, because you can't add password later
  (and thus you can never login via their desktop app etc)

2) Click to books, select book, click dot-dot-dot, click download.  It will download a tiny "key" file .acsm that can only be loaded in abode digital editions.

3) Install Adobe digital editions. This is also kinda a pain in the ass to find the link (app store doesn't work), but is freeware.

4) Double click the .acsm file. It will open in Adobe. Adobe will ask you to "authorize" -- no idea what that means.
  I chose authorize without an account. It churned for a while then said fine. At this point the epub is in **~/Documents/Digital Editions**

5) Install Calibre. At this point the ebook won't open in Calibre due to DRM.

6) Manually install plugin of DeDRM by downloading zip file from https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM\_tools/releases , then doing
  _Calibre -> Preferences -> Preferences -> plugins -> load plugin from file --> select zip file_

7) Restart Calibre so the plugin is fully loaded

8) Add Adobe Digital Editions key to Calibre: get back to the plugin, choose DeDRM --> customize. Then add keys. Then I pressed "+" and it auto found and loaded the ADE key.  I think the key manually exists in **~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Digital Editions/activation.dat**

9) Then I could add the epub (file from step #4) to Calibre. I could double click it and actually read it. Good, that means calibre can see the doc.

10) Click Caliber icon for "Convert Books".  Choose epub and then ok (takes a few seconds).
   Then I repeated, choosing pdf and then ok (takes a few seconds).
   At this point the epub and pdf files are in `~/Calibre Library/<author>/<title>/`
