An Honest Look at Private Equity

Advantages:
- Access to small, fast growing companies that is difficult to find elsewhere
- Majority control, which allows tighter management feedback loops (think Buffett)
- Perhaps (?) uncorrelated with public equities
- Access to non-recourse leverage
- Structural earnings multiple step up (small to mid is consistent step-up)
- Investing in bread-and-butter American small businesses


Disadvantages:
- Cannot meaningfully measure performance for many years
- Capital calls at arbitrary times require liquidity and frequent email access
- Capital is called over many years, which aggravates the intermediate liquidity & investment situation
- Typically less than committed capital is called, but no guarantee
- Performance fee is based on IRR, which somewhat misaligns mgmt & investors
  (ex: sell after 6 months at +30% or after 12 months at +50%. Mgmt will sell after 6)
- K1 tax complications
  - typically arrive after 4/15
  - can include state-source income, requiring a tax return in those states
  - K1 accounting is complex and it's hard to tell if you're being treated fairly
- You lose all timing over taxable income and type
- The 2% mgmt fee is not tax deductable, but gains are fully taxed, which creates a super-tax regime
- The private equity space is very competitve, increasing the risk of overpaying or adverse selection
- The fund's success depends a lot on the team, but the team can be fragile due to back loaded comp
  (good people may leave early, which is highly disruptive, if they anticipate a small performance fee)
