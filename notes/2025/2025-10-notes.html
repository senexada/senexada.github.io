<li><p><strong>Eastern vs. Western Easter</strong> -- Julian vs Gregorian calendar --
<a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~pantsakl/Archive/dateofeaster.pdf">Notre Dame article</a> --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the Nicaean Ecumenical Council of 325 AD, Easter should be celebrated on the 
first Sunday after the first full moon after the Spring (Vernal) Equinox. All Eastern and
Western churches follow this Ecumenical Council ruling. The differences come from the
different interpretation of these rules.</p>

<p>The Eastern Christian Churches (Orthodox) follow the Julian calendar in calculating Easter
dates, while the Western Christian Churches (Catholic, Protestant) follow the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>The Eastern Churches have fixed the above "Vernal Equinox" to be March 21 of the Julian
calendar, which currently is April 3 in the Gregorian calendar. So, in Eastern churches,
Easter falls between April 4 and May 8, while in Western churches Easter falls between March 22 and April 25.</p>

<p>The above "fist full moon after the Vernal Equinox" is not the actual full moon, but it is a
calculated, ecclesiastical full moon called the Paschal Full Moon. Eastern churches calculate
it using the March 21 Julian calendar Vernal Equinox date, and a method involving the 19-year moon cycle (Metonic cycle) is used.</p>

<p>The Western churches use an astronomical accurate time for the Vernal Equinox, which may
be on March 20 or March 21 and a corrected, more accurate moon cycle (Gregorian method)
to calculate the Paschal Full Moon. To determine the Paschal Full Moon, the exact times of
full moon around March 20 are calculated and compared with the exact time of the Vernal Equinox. </p>
