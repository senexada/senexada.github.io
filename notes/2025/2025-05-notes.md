  > Cram down financings are inherently prone to legal challenge because, from the perspective
    of a non-participating stockholder that has been heavily diluted, there may be little
    downside to bringing a lawsuit. Minority stockholders sometimes simply sit on their rights
    following a cram down financing and may only bring suit if the company reverses its
    fortunes and achieves a successful exit — and the plaintiff law firms are often more than
    willing to bring a case on contingency at little cost to the complaining stockholders. In other
    words, even if the financing is successful and the company experiences a turn-around, the
    litigation risk from a cram down financing can create a permanent cloud over the company,
    which can sometimes scare off acquirors and spoil a potential exit event.

* Borges on Firing Line with William F. Buckley -- Episode S0267, Recorded on February 1, 1977
  > ( transcript starting at 17:18 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNxzQSheCkc )

  > Borges: I have done most of my reading in English.
    I find English a far finer language than Spanish.

  > Buckley: Why?

  > Borges: There are many reasons.
    
  > Firstly, English is both a Germanic and a Latin language; it holds two registers.
    For example, for any idea you take you have two words.
    Those words will not mean exactly the same.
    For example, if I say regal, it's not exactly the same thing as saying kingly.
    Or if I say fraternal, I'm not saying brotherly, or dark and obscure:
    those words are different.
    It would make all the difference, speaking for example, of the Holy Spirit --
    it would make all the difference in the world in a poem if I wrote about the
    Holy Spirit or I wrote the Holy Ghost, since ghost is a fine, dark, Saxon word,
    while Spirit is a light Latin word.

  > And then there is another reason.
    The reason is that I think that of all languages, English is the most physical
    of all languages. You can, for example, say "he loomed over."
    You can't very well say that in Spanish.

  > Buckley: Asomo?

  > Borges: No, no, they're not exactly the same.

  > And then you have -- in English you can do almost anything with verbs and
    prepositions. For example, to laugh off, to dream away. Those things can't
    be said in Spanish. To live down something, to live up to something.
    You can't say those things in Spanish. They can't be said; or really in any
    Romance language.  I suppose they can be said in German, although my German
    really isn't too good.

  > I taught myself German for the sake of reading Schopenhauer in the text.
    That was way back in 1916. I had read Schopenhauer in English; I was
    greatly attracted to Schopenhauer; and I thought I would try to read the
    text, and then I taught myself German.

  > [... 19:53] then of course in Spanish, the words are far too cumbersome, far
    too long. Well, I go to one of my [indistinct]. For example, if you take an English
    adverb, or two English adverbs, you say for instance -- quickly, slowly --
    then the stress falls on the significant part of the word: __quick__ly,
    __slow__ly.  But if you say it in Spanish, you say lentamente, rapidamente,
    the stress falls on the the nonsignificant part, on the gadget. And that makes
    it a very cumbersome language.

  > [... 29:30] Buckley: Is Shakespeare successfully translated into Spanish?

  > Boges: No. Shakespeare also, I mean, he was involved in music, in wordcraft.
    That kind of thing can't be translated. I attempted a translation of Macbeth,
    and then after a scene or two I felt I couldn't do it and I left it.

  > [... 55:17] In the case of Shakespeare, for example, I suppose that half the
    beauty lies in the language, and therefore it can't be translated. [...]

### Backpacking notes

* Emerald & Sapphire Lakes, Trinity Alps (CA) --
  recommended by AIs. But actual distance seems like 9 miles from trailhead
  (due to Old Caribou Lakes Trail, 4.9mi; on Gaiagps, confirmed 
  [here][caribou]) -- also, first two trip reports I found mentioned crowds
  * [report 1][emerald1]
    > There were several groups camped at Morris Meadows so we wanted to get to the lake
      before other groups took the best campsites.  We set off at about 7:30 am and reached
      Emerald Lake at about 9:30 am.  Along the way several hikers recommended camping at
      Sapphire Lake instead of Emerald Lake because it was prettier and less busy.
      
  * [report 2][emerald2] -- reports it's hot due to low-ish elevation

* Buffett and Munger on EBITDA
  * Buffett: Not thinking about depreciation as an expense strikes us as absolutely crazy.
    There are very few businesses where depreciation is not a real expense.
  * Buffett: Any management that doesn’t regard depreciation as an expense is living in a dream world
  * Buffett: It has helped certain people to build fortunes by misleading investors to think EBIDTA is a big deal.
  * Munger: The idea of using a measure you know is nonsense, and then piling additional reasoning on that false
    assumption is not credible intellectual performance
  * Buffett: A generation of investors have been brought up to believe in EBITDA and to discount
    depreciation. However, depreciation is a real expense. It is not a non-cash expense.
    It is a cash expense. The only difference is that you spend it first. The cash is gone.
    It is a delayed recording of cash.
  * Munger: I think you would understand any presentation using the word EBITDA if every time you
    saw that word you just substituted the phrase "bullshit earnings"

  [link for most quotes][ebitda] --
  [link to video for the quotes][video-ebitda] --
  [link for Munger quote from 2003 Berkshire meeting][bullshit] --

  > (full transcript. Starting 1:10 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHd6Xj1cMR0 )

  > We regularly told you for some years before the accounting change was made
    a year or so ago -- we told you you should not count goodwill amortization. It was required under GAAP,
    and we obviously complied with GAAP, but we told you virtually every year that this is not really an economic expense. And we ignore it
    in our own calculations of earnings, in terms of what we will pay for businesses: we don't
    care whether there is a goodwill item or not, because it is immaterial to economic reality.

  > So we have been quite willing at Berkshire to tell our own owners to ignore certain things,
    and if they disagree with us they can look at the GAAP figures;
    but we felt they were getting misled by looking at the amortization of intangibles.
    That doesn't mean we think all intangibles were good --
    we did feel that was an arbitrary decision that didn't make any sense at all.
    And we felt obviously that
    crazy pension assumptions have caused people to report phantom earnings in many cases.
    So we're willing to tell you when we think there's data that is more important
    in economic analysis than GAAP figures; we'll talk to you about it.

  > Not thinking of depreciation as an expense, though, strikes us as absolutely crazy. I can think of
    very few businesses -- I can think of a couple -- but I can think of very few businesses
    where depreciation is not a real expense. Even in our gas
    pipelines, at some point, they will need repairs, but beyond that, at some point they will become
    obsolete. There won't be gas there 200 years from now, we know that.

  > Depreciation is real, and it's the worse kind of expense: it's reverse float. You lay out the money
    before you get revenue.   And you are out cash with nothing coming in.
    Any management that doesn't regard depreciation as an expense is living
    in a dream world. But of course they're encouraged to do that by investment bankers who talk to them about EBITDA
    and certain people have built fortunes by misleading investors by convincing them that
    EBITDA was a big deal.

  > When we see companies that say "hey, we don't pay any taxes, because we don't
    have any earnings for tax purposes, and don't count depreciation" and all that -- that's coming, in our
    view, many times that's coming very close to a flim flam game.  And I get these people who want to show me
    books with EBITDA in it, and I tell them, I'll look at that figure when
    you tell me you'll make all the capital expenditures.  If I'm going to make the capital expenditures,
    there are very few businesses where I think I can spend a whole lot less than depreciation year after
    year and maintain the economic strength of the business.

  > So I think that EBITDA has been a term that
    has cost a lot of investors a lot of money. You saw it in the telecom field -- they were spending money
    so damn fast they couldn't have it coming in the door fast enough from investors;
    and then they pretended depreciation was not a real expense. That's nonsense. It couldn't be
    worse. And a generation of investors was brought up to believe in that.

  > We at Berkshire will spend more than our depreciation this year. We spent more than our depreciation
    last year, we spent more than our depreciation the year before that. Deprecation is a real expense.
    It's not a non-cash expense. It's a cash expense -- you just spent it first. The cash is gone.
    It's just delayed recording of cash expense. How anybody can turn that into something they use as a
    metric that talks about earnings is beyond me.

  > Charlie: I think you would understand any presentation using the word EBITDA if every time you saw
    that word, you substituted the word "Bullshit earnings"


* Berkshire 2000 report on EBITDA:
  _"References to EBITDA make us shudder æ does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?
We’re very suspicious of accounting methodology that is vague or unclear, since too often that means management
wishes to hide something. "_
   [2000 berkshire report][berk2000]

* Berkshire 2017 meeting discussion: 
  > Warren: In respect to EBITDA, depreciation is an expense, and it's the worst kind of an expense.
    We love to talk about float, and float is where we get the money first and have the expense later.
    Depreciation is where you spend the money first, and then record the expense later. It's reverse float.
    And it's not a good thing.

  > And to have that enter into a multiple -- it's much better to buy a business that has, everything else
    being equal, has no depreciation,
    because it has essentially no investment in fixed assets and it makes X, 
    then buy a company where there's a lot of depreciation and getting X,
    and actually I might write a little more about that next year, because it's such a mass delusion,
    and of course it's in the interest of Wall Street to focus on EBITDA because it
    results in higher borrowing, higher valuations, and all that sort of thing.

  > It's become very popular in the last 20 years but it's a very misleading statistic that can
    be used in very pernicious ways.  Charlie?

  >  Charlie: I think you've understated the horrors of the subject and the disgusting nature of the people
    who brought that term into the valuation of business. It would be like a leasing broker of
    real estate who had a thousand square foot suite to be leased and he says it's got
    2000 feet in it. That's not honorable behavior. And that's the way that term got into the
    common usage. Nobody's right mind thinks that depreciation is not an expense.

  >  W: But it's very much in the interest of Wall St.

  > C: Yes, that's why they did it: it made the multiples seem lower.

  > W: What's amazing is the way it's accepted actually. But anyway.
    It just illustrates how people use language and sell
    concepts that work to their own use.
    And 2 and 20 has the same sort of thing. The number
    of people, the amount of money, that's overperformed after paying 2 and 20 compared
    to the expenses incurred makes for a terrible indictment of that particular
    arrangement. But as long as it can get sold it will get sold.

  > C: Now they use it in the business schools. That is horror squared. It's bad enough that
    a bunch of thieves are using a term. But when it gets so common the busines schools copy
    it: that's not a good result. 

    [link to video of 2017 meeting snippet on ebitda][2017]

* Berkshire 2013 letter discussing
  (a) GAAP amortization applies to both things that truly deplete, and things that don't,
  so it makes sense to add color commentary,
  (b) Depreciation is always an expense: "Every dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost. And that’s true at almost all other
  companies as well. When Wall Streeters tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, button your wallet."
  (c) Berkshire reports GAAP and then adds commentary on what adjustments to amortization
  seem more indicative of true business prospects.

   [only trip report I've found][tipp] --
   >  In total, it took me about 2 hours to get to the lake from the junction.
      As a campsite, the lake was a huge disappointment. There is no flat shoreline to speak of, 
      unless it was on the opposite (north) shore. Everything on the south shore was forest filled
      with alder. I could have circled the lake on either shore, but on the west shore was another
      avalanche path and on the east was some serious cliffs that would have required gaining a
      bit of elevation before dropping back down. I had been hoping to use the lake as a base for
      exploring the alpine terrain above the lake, but there were only two routes from the lake to
      that terrain. One was an avalanche chute, and the other was a long, steep, dry creek bed
      going up a grassy slope. As I didn't want to camp at the lake, my only other option for

* Lifestraw -- requires big wide dirty water bottle, else must lie down at streams --
  [snarky nomad][snarky]
  > whenever you want a drink of water, you have to: Open the bottle,
     Open the Lifestraw’s top cap, Open the Lifestraw’s bottom cap,
     Stick the Lifestraw inside, Drink, Take it out, Expel the remaining water,
     Close the top cap, Close the bottom cap, Close the bottle.
     And then…you’ve got a wet Lifestraw, so you’ll probably end up with wet clothes.
