<h2>Estate Details</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Federal Estate Tax</b> - Must file IRS Form 706 (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i706/ch01.html">instructions</a>) if estate exceeds $5.4M (2015). Otherwise no requirement to file, unless you wish to transfer Exemption surplus to the surviving spouse (which is useful if surviving spouse will have >$5.4M).  Executor files 706 and must have proof of status: notarized will or court order.</li>

  <li><b>Michigan Estate Tax</b> - Inactive starting 2005 and still true in 2016 (<a href="http://www.michigan.gov/taxes/0,1607,7-238-44143-156393--,00.html">MI Estate Tax Forms page</a>). MI tax is linked to federal state death tax credit, so it may reappear if federal law changes. </li>

  <li><b>Michigan Probate</b> - <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/michigan-probate-an-overview.html">Nolo Press</a> says probate is only required if deceased person owns assets in his name alone. </li>

  <li><b>Annuities</b> - All withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Annuities are one of the few assets that does NOT qualify for step-up basis upon inheritance.</li>

  <li><b>Unrecorded Real Estate Transfers</b> - (Quit Claim Deeds, etc) - When trying to record them years later, it will probably work if there are no competing claims, but:
    <ul>
       <li>The recipient's cost basis will be as of the signed date</li>
       <li>It may cause a retroactive increase in State Equalized Value (MI) or equivalent, which will incur back taxes and penalties</li>
       <li>It may retroactively disqualify property tax Homestead Exemption (MI), incurring back taxes and penalties</li>
       <li>It may retroactively disqualify state income tax Homestead credit (MI), incurring back taxes and penalties</li>

    </ul>

<h2>Planning Ahead</h2>

Easy, short term items:
<ul>
  <li><b>Will</b> - write or review your will. Nolo Press is a good resource.
      Most important points to cover are child custody, child trusts, and unusual assets.
      Ordinary bank and investments typically follow the beneficiary designation. </li>
  <li><b>Health Power of Attorney</b> - write or review your health POA. Many states
      have free online statuatory forms.  Most important points are to review the designee and alternates,
      and to have as few triggering conditions as you are comfortable with. </li>
  <li><b>Financial Power of Attorney</b> - write or review your financial POA.
      Many states have free online statuatory forms.  Most important points are to review the assignee
      and alternates, to have as few triggering conditions as you can tolerate, and to
      ensure it says a copy is as valid as the original (many entities will otherwise require
      the original)</li>
  <li><b>Beneficiaries</b> - list all financial accounts and check/set the beneficiary for each</li>
  <li><b>Notification</b> - notify a family member of the location of your documents.
      If they are difficult to access (in an controlled-access apartment, safety deposit box,
      etc), make arrangements for access. Note that Safety Deposit Boxes are sealed upon death.</li>
  <li><b>Wishes Document</b> - write or review your "wishes" document, which contains non
      binding useful information for hiers, including a list of your assets, funeral
      preferences, etc.  [add link to my sample]</li>
</ul>

More difficult, longer term items
<ul>
  <li><b>Consider State of Residence</b> - some states have high estate taxes even for modestly sized estates.
    See <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.ord">Tax Foundation</a> maps.

  </li>
  <li><b>Living Trusts or LLCs</b> - put non-beneficiary property into a Living Trust or LLC
      to avoid probate. Do this for all real estate plus any unusual assets</li>
  <li><b>Simplify Accounts</b> - review accounts and consolidate or close unnecessary ones.
      Each separate entity causes significant extra paperwork</li>
  <li><b>Large Estate Tax Planning</b> - for estates that may reach federal tax levels, consider
      planning measures:
      <ul>
	<li>Annual gifts - maximize annual gift tax exclusion. Use high cost basis items,
            leaving low cost basis items in estate for basis step-up</li>
        <li>Use the exclusion early - it locks in today's exclusion as a min, and allows
            money to grow during your life outside your estate</li>
	<li>Use GRATs - transer money via GRATs, which uses no exclusion</li>
        <li>Donate - donate appreciated securities to charity (todo: find out if donations can trigger upon death)</li>
	<li>Divest of difficult assets - those that are complicated to value or subdivide</li>
      </ul>
   </li>

</ul>
