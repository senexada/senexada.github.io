### Misc Articles

* __Thank you for being annoying__ -- annoyance as a motivator to do things that create a sense of achievement and completion -- "happiness comes not from the absence of error in these systems, but from the correction of error. That is, happiness isn’t a full belly, it’s a belly that’s being filled. So if you wanna feel good, you gotta let things get at least a little out of whack so you can whack them back into place again. The whacking is, in fact, the fun part." --

### Health / fitness

* __Strong First__ -- kettle bell guy, Pavel --
  book is [Kettlebell Simple and Sinister][kettle-book] --
  standard workout is 10 one-arm swings every 30sec, alternating hands, for 5 minutes, 32kg, then one min rest, then 10 getups, starting on the minute 
  [link with form notes][kettle-workout] --
  general philosophy is "specialized variety" or "same but different": same exercises, large daily diffs in weights, reps, and minor stuff --
  [link to philosophy][kettle-philo]
  > A bodyweight example is doing pullups with a variety of grips (narrow, medium, wide; over, under, parallel, staggered; thumbs wrapped, thumbs over, false; uneven), timing (explosive, slow, with a 3sec pause on the top of each rep, etc.), equipment (a straight bar, parallel bars, rings, towels), and the placement and the nature of added resistance (kettlebells on the feet, a weight belt, a weight vest; bands; chains; artificial controlling environment). In contrast, rows do not constitute SV for pullups.
