<blockquote>
  <p>But what kind of information are you trying to learn from a fiction book?
The book is literally labelled FALSE on the cover. I can hear the outraged
answer from the literati already. It will be something like “I read to
understand the human condition by engaging deeply with a wide breadth of
human experience and perspectives.” Good. I agree. And since this is the
same basic answer as to why you should read history, philosophy, etc as well
(books that are deceptively labelled NOT FALSE on the cover), I think it’s fair
to lump all these subjects together.</p>

<p>But if this answer is correct, it leads us to a troubling conclusion: New
books are not worth reading. Why? Because everyone alive today has the same
perspective, and none of us have experienced a wide breadth of anything.
Especially not those of us who are likely to get platformed by a major publisher.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only way to access the trailhead is to contract with an Indian guide to have them drive
 you to and from the trailhead. Contact Ramona O'Neal (Mone) at 307-486-2318 for
 transportation. She lives right next door to the Crowheart Store / gas station. The driveway
to her home is 20 feet north of the store.</p>

<p>The standard meeting time is 8am at Mone's house, and 11am at the Cold Springs trailhead
for the return ride. The ride to/from the trailhead is about 1.5 hours over a rough 4WD dirt
 road. You leave your car at Mone's house. Cost for the transportation seems to vary,
 depending perhaps on whether or not there are any other pick-ups / drop-offs combined with
 yours. When I first called Mone, she quoted a cost of $600 round trip for 2 people. When I
called back to reserve a date and told her there were 3 of us, the price was still $600 total.
Then when I arrived and there were only 2 of us, the price dropped to $500. (I didn't question
the discount.) </p>

<li><strong>whatifalist</strong> on socialism -- <a href="https://nitter.net/whatifalthist/status/1990524157419728911#m">nitter post</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the horrifying things I realized was Socialism was basically voting public’s begging to
have serfdom again. This was something that was widely said during the early USSR, which
was called “the second serfdom” by Russian peasants. In both there’s no private property,
everything is collective and under total ownership by a repressive state. Russia was unusually
bad as serfdom went, with High Medieval Western Europe being way better than either.</p>

<p>What the Socialist says when he wants no struggle, no property, no competition and no choice
is “I crave a life of slavery that doesn’t require I think or take responsibility for my choices at all”.
That’s why Communism always devolves into the state forcing you to work with terrible
conditions, which is de facto identical to slavery. The fact he's not mature  enough to realize
he's doing this should more than prove my point.</p>

<p>The feudal lord is way nicer by and large than the Socialist state. My historic speciality is the
Middle Ages. You don’t want to fight me on this. The feudal lord gets to be rich and powerful
while the Socialist state is impersonal. That’s the core of it. They would rather live in slavery
than live better and know someone else is better than them</li>
