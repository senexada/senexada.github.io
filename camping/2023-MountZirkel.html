  <span class="dropcap">A</span>nother Labor Day weekend, another trip to
    the east slopes of the Mt Zirkel wilderness.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

<p class="regtext">
  September 1, 2023 -- this year we stayed in Silverthorne, which was a good
  trade vs Walden: earlier night, better hotel, more breakfast and shopping options.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  Leaving the hotel at 9:08am, we reached the forest boundary in 2h15 and soon
  saw forest road 650, which looked like a reasonable option on the map, but even
  the first few hundred yards were too dicey for a rental SUV. We abanodoned that
  idea without hesitation.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  Midday on a Friday of Labor Day, there were three cars at North Fork, zero at South Fork.
  I somehow forgot the eggs -- doh.  We were walking by 12:30 through the
  biggest aspens I've seen.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
In the first two hours we traversed through aspen, hopped across the first
live water (about an hour in), stopped for lunch, and passed two backpackers
near an old cabin.  And we found coveted wild raspberry bushes along the creek & rockslide
area.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  Partway up the valley we decided on a direct bushwacking route to Lake X.
  We departed the trail and for an hour of challenging steep underbrush in
  prime territory.  Upon reaching the lake, we pre dug some holes, filtered water, and collected wood, but
  were too hungry to wait for coals; so we pan fried the burgers.  Potato bun would
  have been even better. Pickles were great.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We faced some big wind gusts and spurts of rain during cleanup, but nothing drenching.
The gusts & the dead pines made it somewhat challenging to find safe tent sites.

<br/><p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
Sat morning --

We woke to beautiful reds on the mountain tops and Watson already fishing.
A solo backpacker passed us on the way out; hhe was presumably there last night
be we hadn't seen him (or anyone) at our lake.  My notes say we "redeemed the
loss of the eggs" -- but they don't say how! Maybe we sizzled the lunch ham.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Today's activity was a day hike to the continental divide, with frequent stops
for marmot and pika viewing.  Watson could have used even more viewing time.
Great views down to X park and over the divide into the Zirkel wilderness.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
On the way down I scouted the next valley north, but the topography was such
that I couldn't see any lakes by my turnaround time.
</p>


<p class="regtext">
The afternoon swim was superb, thought Patton said it gave him "hypothermia times 3".
I saw another 5 ppl and 2 dogs in our vicinity.  We almost finished our first fuel
canister while cooking the mac and cheese.
</p>



Lake to junction - 0:38
junction to top - 0:31

food notes: more cheese! salami or pepperoni instead of turkey. beans ??
  too many tortillas. don't forget eggs.

Sun morning

Swiss miss and panckes -- the 2 hour affair.  At 10am the bombardment began
of the flotilla on the lake. What Watson deemed "enhanced construction" meant
the flotilla was "still legally alive" even as they were "running out of rocks."

We walked around the lake, which had some nice boulder scrambles.
We had a couple violent rainfalls and a snowfall. Fun to sit under teh tarp and watch.

Bill tended the fire from noon til 9pm.

Mon

Awake at 6sm, walking by 7:45am (within 15 mins of our target). Passed back through
the big aspens in a blustery fall day, deep shadows alternating with bright
sunshine, really beautiful spot.  These moments were a highlight of the trip.

We were back to the car before noon and on our way to Silverthorne.
