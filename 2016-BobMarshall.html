<p class="regtext"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ho is Bob Marshall?
Why have I never heard of him or his wilderness?  Where is this place?
Queue the back story.</p>

<hr>


<p class="regtext">It begins with a genuinely useful
publication of our general government: a map of distance to the nearest
road in the lower 48 states (original pdf 
<a href="https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/products/publications/21426/21426.pdf">here</a>,
and as usual, click any photo for the full res version).</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-VbwvHSW/0/O/US-dist-to-road.png"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-VbwvHSW/0/L/US-dist-to-road-L.png"></a><p class="caption">Courtesy of USGS</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The algorithm is simple: find the biggest
dark green spots we haven't visited.  Future candidates include the
Olympics & Cascades (WA), Frank Church (ID), and Yellowstone complex (WY).  This year
we chose the largest green blob in Montana, which happens to be called the Bob Marshall complex.
The 1.5 million acre wilderness was named for an early conservationist.</p>

<p class="regtext">Oddly-named wilderness areas remain obscure for reasons I don't understand
but I do enjoy. Compared to national park backcountry, the scenery is comparable, the permits
easier, the camping and fire rules friendlier, and the crowds smaller.
For background, a wilderness designation prohibits roads, permanent structures, and mechanized travel,
with few grandfathered exceptions.  About 5% of the lower 48 states (110 million acres) are
officially wilderness, in addition to other public lands that happen to be roadless.</p>

<p class="regtext">If you think "The Bob" is a strange name, the naming gets even stranger.
The Bob's marquee feature, a 1000 foot cliff
that extends unbroken for 20 miles along the continental divide, is called
the Chinese Wall.  With a description and name like that, we had to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">Montana has truly big skies.  The rolling prairies and
mesas, dotted with more cattle and horses than people, surrender abruptly to forest
at the foothills.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-fK3xf8v/0/O/IMG_2984.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-fK3xf8v/0/L/IMG_2984-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Near Augusta, MT</p></div>

<p class="regtext"> At one point we had to stop for three steer occupying the road,
and those steer outnumbered the cars we saw in the hour between Augusta and Benchmark.
The end of the road had a well-marked trailhead, a paucity of cars, and a luxurious outhouse.</p>

<p class="regtext">I'm becoming increasingly partial to the northern Rockies.
They have numerous rivers and green undergrowth. Their trails are wild
and scenic but not too high or steep or dry for visitors from sea level
carrying steaks, bacon, sausage, and eggs.</p>

<hr>

<p class="regtext">We entered along the Continental Divide Trail (CDT).
It was gently rolling, well trodden, with several bridges, allowing rapid travel into
the backcountry with modest exertion.  The view from the first pack bridge, a few hundred
yards from the car, was pure Montana.

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-3DxBwqk/0/O/IMG_2981.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-3DxBwqk/0/L/IMG_2981-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Getting straight to business: the South Fork Sun</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The trail goes north through shady forest, yielding to
burn scars in the lower valley, yielding to open meadows west of the confluence.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-qz7zkfV/0/O/IMG_2751.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-qz7zkfV/0/L/IMG_2751-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Above the South Fork and West Fork confluence</p></div>

<p class="regtext">It then follows the West Fork Sun, sometimes low in a meadow,
sometimes high enough for a view. </p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-XTnMCQj/0/O/IMG_2758.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-XTnMCQj/0/L/IMG_2758-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Low in a meadow</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Thanks to our early-ish start we traveled 11 miles and made
camp at 4pm just before the Ahorn trail junction. We had hours of sunshine
to cook the steaks and spinach and
assemble the fresh kale salad.  We should strive to start every trip so early.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-W3hGgzm/0/O/IMG_2763.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-W3hGgzm/0/L/IMG_2763-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Backcountry kale</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We felt great. I had no overexertion from a steep climb,
no altitude problems (we were at 5400'; net gain of zero from the car, but 
about 1000' of up-and-down), and no dehydration. There
was no wind sapping our heat. We had a campfire to cook ribeye and to keep us
warm and social after sundown.</p>

<p class="regtext">Day Two - The skies cleared overnight, revealing modest stars
and causing a chilly morning.  Jason's breakfast burritos were as good as ever, with
open fire bacon and pan-fried bacon, eggs (in the bacon grease), cheese, onion,
and warm tortillas.  Alex has achieved true mastery of campfire bacon.</p>

<p class="regtext">We left camp at 10:10, immediately passed the Ahorn junction,
shortly passed Indian Point, and soon reached White River Pass trail, which starts
with an ice cold shoes-off crossing.  The fire scars ended along this stretch
and the forest grew greener and denser as we ascended.  A thick clump of raspberries
distracted us for 10 minutes.</p>



<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-vtpfCDd/0/O/IMG_2774.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-vtpfCDd/0/L/IMG_2774-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">The gathering instinct at work</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We chased the raspberries with occasional trailside thimbleberries
until lunch, which featured turkey pitas with cheese, avacado, and tomato.
The forest opened up to the first vistas above Indian Creek.</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-DSrKtLW/0/O/IMG_2780.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-DSrKtLW/0/L/IMG_2780-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Upper Indian Creek Valley</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We left the trail at the final stream crossing (~7160')
and followed an unofficial trail to the saddle above Red Butte Creek. Here
we got our first glimpse of the 1000' cliffs of the Chinese Wall.
</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-368ssTX/0/O/IMG_2941.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-368ssTX/0/L/IMG_2941-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">JC and about 1/8 of the Chinese Wall</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We followed disappearing game trails across marshy ground
at equal elevation until we reached the unnamed lake in the upper Red Butte valley,
our site for the next two nights.  There was bear poop in the middle of the 
optimal tenting area, but it was old enough to be unconcerning.</p>

<p class="regtext">Padraig cooked a tomato pasta with pepperoni and delicious shitakes.
We made another fire and stayed up late.  I got the best night's camping sleep
I've had in years; if this post doesn't grow too long I'll talk later about this
year's experimental techniques.</p>

<p class="regtext">Day Three - What a day! We awoke to this:</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-SQpGZJ6/0/O/IMG_2807.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-SQpGZJ6/0/L/IMG_2807-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">The view from my sleeping bag</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Our stationary day supports a customary two hour endeavor
to prepare and cook (and clean up from) pancakes and bacon, which is worth every minute.
  Bill salvaged the soupy batter with an amoeba/rorschach
technique that achieved better browning than I achieve in a kitchen.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-RqPMPBh/0/O/IMG_2810.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-RqPMPBh/0/L/IMG_2810-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Amoeba cakes</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We argued for an hour about day hike routes, with Alex wanting to
see the Chinese Wall from its foot and JC wanting a high panoramic view.  Our solution
was the best of both worlds: we would circumnavigate the ridge that we named
the Taiwanese Wall (southeast and smaller than the Chinese Wall). It was a tidy loop,
entirely off trail, about the right length (4-5 hours), and offering both low and high perspectives on the wall.
Bill, JC, Alex, and I were in; the Rogers and Suhas were relaxing.</p>

<p class="regtext">The steepest and slowest portion was the initial 600'
descent to Red Butte Creek. We avoided the few unhikeable grades by
switching back up the valley. We passed through some huckleberry
patches that foreshadowed serious grizzly habitat a bit later.
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-9QFFK93/0/O/IMG_2819.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-9QFFK93/0/L/IMG_2819-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Down to Red Butte Creek</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We crossed the creek and followed on-and-off game trails
at roughly constant elevation (~6600') through increasingly prime bear territory.
As we rounded the apex of the ridge we found copious huckleberries, disturbed soil,
frequent scat, and fresh tracks. I would not want to hike this portion alone.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-7RvVj7j/0/O/IMG_2827.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-7RvVj7j/0/L/IMG_2827-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Bear country</p></div>

<p class="regtext">Several years ago in Glacier we found huge fields of huckleberries.
This valley put even those to shame: we walked for over an hour through nearly-continuous huckleberries,
tangy and sweet, so many huckleberries that the bears pooped purple-blue:</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-LMczdjq/0/O/IMG_2836.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-LMczdjq/0/L/IMG_2836-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Huckleberries to the limit</p></div>

<p class="regtext">As we hiked upstream, the gaps in the forest revealed the grandeur of the Chinese Wall.
It was definitely worth seeing from below.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-688DMXj/0/O/IMG_2840.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-688DMXj/0/L/IMG_2840-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Chinese Wall from below</p></div>

<p class="regtext">For the next hour, each opening
was more stunning than the last.  We stopped at one such vista for lunch:
the no-cleanup, easily subdividable, yet delicious, gouda, gruyere, pepperoni, and crackers.
Shorly afterward we found this spot at about 6800'
that would make a great campsite (except for the early sunsets).</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-wfjDD3d/0/O/IMG_2842.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-wfjDD3d/0/L/IMG_2842-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">More Chinese Wall</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The valley soon climbs above the treeline.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-3cM2SqZ/0/O/IMG_2871.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-3cM2SqZ/0/L/IMG_2871-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Hiking higher</p></div>

<p class="regtext">An easily hikeable grade reached our exit pass (~8200'), which sits
at the southern terminus of the Chinese Wall, NNW of White River Pass. The scenery
was superb to the horizon in all directions.  And despite walking several hours along
the Wall's footing, we had seen only about a third of its total length, the northern
portion being occluded by the protrusion at Cliff Mountain.
</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-s9Xnhxf/0/O/IMG_9766.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-s9Xnhxf/0/L/IMG_9766-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Posing at our high point, the southern terminus of the Chinese Wall</p></div>

<p class="regtext">It took less than an hour to traverse and descend to our
campsite, which is the lake midway up the right slope.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-gK5kR6q/0/O/IMG_2899.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-gK5kR6q/0/L/IMG_2899-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Home sweet home in sight</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We arrived at camp, greated the relaxers, and swam very briefly
in the pockets of sunshine.  The perceived temperature varied by 20 degrees (?)
between sun and shade: when sunny, comfortable though wet and nearly naked; when shady,
wanting a jacket though dry and fully clothed.</p>

<p class="regtext">After Jambalaya dinner -- well proportioned with old chicken
and moldy sausage -- we built a respectable fire and burned a recalcitrant log in half
until 11pm.  Roger sowed confusion about the exit hike,
and he and Alex debated the trail running time to the car.</p>

<p class="regtext">At bedtime, inspired by a prior conversation with dchen,
I made my first ever attempt at nighttime photography.  On my own monitor
its clarity depends on brightness, ambient light, and viewing angle.
I rate it passable, given that it is a first attempt with a six-year-old point-and-shoot camera
(the next night's photo, further below, is a little better).

<p class="regtext">Day Four -- We had three options for the day: a backtrack of day two,
a backtrack all the way to the car, and a partial loop exit through Ahorn and Hoadley valleys.
Roger lobbied for the full exit, though with mischievous conviction.  We harbored some suspicion
that Roger had not actually brought the fourth night's dinner. Alex and Jason and I entertained
the Ahorn loop, though the extra length -- an extra 8+ miles and 2000'+, by our
best estimate -- was intimidating.  The chia oatmeal cooked & cleaned quickly, and amidst
intrigue and accusations of sandbagging we began at 9:30am, just as the sun crested the ridge.</p>

<p class="regtext">The return passed quickly without the novelty of
new scenery, especially since it was downhill.  Here is the upper part of the
descent, this time traveling east and down the valley towards Prairie Reef.
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-gwjbbx6/0/O/IMG_2951.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-gwjbbx6/0/L/IMG_2951-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Indian Creek towards Prairie Reef</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We passed a few slabs that explained the "reef" nomenclature --
they appear to be rippled like the sea.  I don't know enough geology to say
whether rippling water was actually involved or not.</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-RgZm5f2/0/O/IMG_2952.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-RgZm5f2/0/L/IMG_2952-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">Some "reef" rocks (?)</p></div>

<p class="regtext">We lunched at the Ahorn junction.  My tuna sandwiches,
at 5.5 oz tuna per person, plus mayo, bread, and sides, were way too dense and heavy,
even at our relatively low elevation.
I was accused of sandbagging again.   No more tuna in the future.</p>

<p class="regtext">We were too tired to attempt the Ahorn
loop, which at minimum would have meant an afternoon of 8+ miles and 2000'+.
So we continued retracing our inbound journey.  After another few hours, with
eveyone feeling weary, Jason announced a decent campsite, which we gladly
accepted. Though the day was mostly on trail and downhill, the 13 miles (per gps) were
tiring.  Roger's full exit was not to be.</p>

<p class="regtext">I was too lazy to take photos of our camp. We slowly
setup tents, took foot baths in the icy river, and as the winds grew
gusty we cooked Roger's pesto, which he did in fact possess.</p>

<p class="regtext">The winds, though gusty, were extremely warm -- so warm
it was weird.  Even past 10pm, with strong breezes, it was
pleasant to sit in a t-shirt.  We sweated through the night, and
I'd be surprised if it got below 70.  I believe we
encountered a mild version of the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_wind">Chinook Winds</a>,
 a Montana phenomenon that
once created a record 24-hour temperature swing
(+100 degree swing in 24 hours).</p>

<p class="regtext">The evening had several highlights.  One was the warmth,
allowing comfortable lounging late into our final evening.  One was the book
discussion while lounging.  One was the sky,
brighter and clearer than any night yet, evoking thoughts of the centuries in which man
had stood in that spot looking at those stars, and which I captured in a
slightly improved nighttime photo session:</p>
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-RPTxqJh/0/O/IMG_2975.jpg"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/2016/Bob-Marshall-Wilderness/i-RPTxqJh/0/L/IMG_2975-L.jpg"></a><p class="caption">When adjusted to see the tree silhouettes, you see what we saw</p></div>

<p class="regtext">The final highlight was the lengthy discussion about the
gusting winds and the large dead tree directly upwind of Alex, Jason, and Suhas.
After many dubious ideas, with Jason eagerly waiting with a rope to try them,
Alex described the XKCD-like solution using Jason's rope attached to his ankle:</p>
