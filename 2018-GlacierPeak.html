<span class="dropcap">A</span>nother eclipse?  Nope. The west was on fire, making for ruddy sunshine, a short trip, and a short (hah) blog post.

Months in advance, Glacier Peak looked idyllic.  We would skirt the volcano, which rises 8000+ vertical feet above the surrounding valleys,
then take an unmaintained trail into seldom-visited Canyon Lake.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
As August arrived, the area looked smokey, but there weren't many alternatives:

Lacking a better alternative, we gave it a shot.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day One</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
We drove into the haze from Best Western Arlington, hoping for favorable winds.  After Darrington, Suiattle River Road
 took us 45 minutes into thickening forest. On this particular Friday morning (Aug 17)
there were 6 cars at the Suiattle River trailhead.  Upon opening the car doors, the sound of rushing water overwhelmed the senses.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
An evocative primordialism pervades the entry hike, a vertical mile below our typical trailheads and near our continent's
only temperate rain forest.  Like Degobah, it shows no signs of civilization but massive lifeform readings. 
<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2018-1/2018-Glacier-Peak/i-2Dgw7jS/0/f8eab103/X3/IMG_3154-X3.jpg">

<p class="caption">Firs, ferns, and copious streams</p></div>
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The trail, often a yard wide and spongy with pine needles, curves along the milky Suiattle in its long, roaring, continuous rapid.
The mighty trees reach eight feet in diameter and rise to neck-craning heights before disappearing into the canopy.  Their trunks are
among the straightest lines in nature.  Everything is green: the boughs and canopies, the moss on the trunks, the ferns and
lichen on steep hillsides.

<p class="regtext">
The trail steepens after the Canyon Creek suspension bridge then steepens again on Miner's Ridge Trail.  A few rare openings offer a glimpse of Glacier Peak, majestic despite the haze.

<p class="regtext">
We stopped at Sunnybrook Camp at the junction of Miner's Ridge and Miner's Cabin trails (4800').  For the archives, it was tight for eight people, it had a pit toilet downhill, a six minute walk to water (forward or back), and no view.  The shade and low elevation allowed us to cover the 12.6mi, 3200' vertical in 6.5 hours (including all stops).  This year I compiled detailed food notes at the end.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
After breakfast we walked the final hour to the crest of Miner's Ridge. This section had no water but copious huckleberries and occasional strawberries.  The smoke thickened until it smelled constantly like campfire.  Meridian sunshine threw the soft pastel shadows of dusk.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
At Miner's Ridge lookout we met Russ doing his month-long volunteer stay for hospitality and restoration.  He told us some history of an earlier helicopter crash, the deadfall preventing stock access, the horses that died on the lower trail, and how he drinks unfiltered water.  Visibility at noon was four miles and declining as we finished the ridge walk to Image Lake.

<p class="caption">Image Lake</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
We abandoned our plans for Canyon Lake (another 8-ish miles directly toward the Bannock Lakes fire).  Bill and I scouted ~30 minutes to Lady Camp, which had a clearing about the size of Sunnybrook, though nestled against trees with views of a sloping meadow.  A stream was close but was only trickling. 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We camped at the group site (plenty large) with three couples also in the area.  Russ came by to warn us of a "smoke storm."  As the smoke thickened, the moon glowed weakly orange, the nearest ridges were indistinct, and my eyes and throat began itching.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
A browsing deer nearly stepped on JC.  After our two hour pancake ritual, the eight-party talks began.  With even JC unsure about a day hike, things looked grim.  No one was enthusiastic to stay and some were eager to leave.  We decided to do the full ~15 miles, -4600' (net) to the cars.

Poor Russ had a "smoke cold" and warned of lightning and continuing smoke.  We left him our surplus cheese and berries and we hauled some of his trash.  Even in the haze it was pleasing to pick berries on the descent.

Excluding the time talking to Russ and lunching at Canyon Creek, we descended in about six hours.  Twenty people had signed the register since our entry 2.5 days ago.

That's all, folks: an inauspicious ending. We did make it out in time for burgers at the demo-friendly (for me, at least) Natty's Junkyard Grill.
