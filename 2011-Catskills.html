     <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40864061/ns/us_news-life/">a million people </a>

     <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/7987.html">Hunter Mountain wilderness</a>
     with a handful of people?  Unseasonably warm weather made the choice easy.</p>

      The traffic at 6am on New Year&#8217;s Day was the lightest I&#8217;ve seen in greater ny:
      less than 2.5 hours to Phoenicia, and another few minutes up 214 to Notch Lake.
      Brooks arrived from Boston a few minutes later.

      First thing we spotted was illegal timbering in the Catskill preserve (click any photo for high res version):

      We planned to hike/snowshoe the 2.2 mile, 1400&#8242; ascent to the Devil&#8217;s Acre Lean-To,
      then assess where to camp. The ascent was steep but pleasant and didn&#8217;t require snowshoes
      on the bottom half:

      The forest was quiet. We saw 2 people leaving an overnight visit on our way up,
      a group of 5 on a day hike, and a solo hiker the following morning. 
      It was otherwise deserted. Daytime temps near 40 deterred the ice climbers.
      Based on our later scouting, we were definitely the only people on SW Hunter that night,
      and likely the only people in a considerably larger radius.
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      After a late lunch at the lean-to we decided to make camp nearby and do some exploring.
      We rejected some areas west and slightly uphill of the lean-to. We bushwhacked through
      boreal pines to a small clearing a few hundred feet south of the trail on SW Hunter
      Mountain and dropped our gear. The early sunset, 4:35pm, precluded a trip to the Hunter
      fire tower. Instead we went westward, seeking the supposed abandoned rail grade up
      SW Hunter peak, which we never found.

      Gloomy skies made 4pm feel like dusk and we began pitching camp. This trip was my second
      experiment with tentless camping, with dual goals of ultra-light and ultra-cheap.
      My ultra-light journey is gradual; slowly getting there. I&#8217;ve always been ultra-cheap.

      I used a 6&#215;9 blue tarp ($4.93 at Home Depot), 50 feet of nylon cord ($3.77),
      and a 2mil plastic dropcloth ($1.98). I already had some 20-year old aluminum stakes.
      Altogether it weighed under 1.5lbs, and there is room to cut weight on both the dropcloth
      and the old-school stakes. Inspired by
      <a href="http://www.rayjardine.com/ray-way/Tarp-Kit/index.htm">Ray Jardin</a>,
      my setup looked like this:

    <p class="regtext">
      Strung about 2.5&#8242; high, with the northwest edge battened down under snow.
      My bag is on the plastic dropcloth. I used a standard pad (not insulted nor extra-thick)
      and wrapped it in the mylar blankets they hand out after marathons &#8212;  free mylar.
      Lightweight and toasty.
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      My total pack weight was 22.5lbs before food and water, 30.2lbs including them.
      My shovel is heavy, my sleeping pad is 10 years old, and I had a 0 degree bag,
      so I have room to cut in the future.

      As night fell (only 5pm), we fought for hours to keep a modest fire alive.
      Even the tiniest twigs were waterlogged from days of freezing rain.
      If we stopped fanning for 2 minutes the flames would die. We nevertheless
      made enough heat to cook dinner and melt drinking water.
    </p>

    <p class="regtext">
      The night was warm by Catskill standards &#8212; low 30s. The tarp performed superbly
      in the overnight bouts of rain &amp; freezing rain. One bout lasted through dawn
      and I discovered a great feature of the tarp: you can safely cook under it.
      Just raise it a few feet and start the stove underneath:

      But the rain was soon displaced by fog and we cooked in the foggy open.
      Brooks opened his canned pineapple and felt like a tropical vacationer:

      Having failed to summit SW Hunter yesterday, we tried again. The forest was thick &#8212;
      would be nearly impassible in summer. After a solid hour, having reached a local high point,
      we declared it the summit. No way to tell if we&#8217;re right, but it felt reasonable.

      Back to camp, packed up, hiked back to the lean-to and ate lunch.
      Skipped the Hunter summit due to the early sunset and the drives back home.
      Caught some clear views south toward Slide Mountain:
