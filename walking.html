Until the 20th century it was customary for active men to walk 30 miles a day in rugged areas.
Evidence is found in realistic fiction, such as Jack London's short story xyz, in which the
main character travels 30 miles a day on foot through snow in the Yukon territory.
It is also found in a variety of nonfiction accounts.  In 
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/jstor-1798466/1798466_djvu.txt">Hind's Exploration up the Moisie River</a>
(in Quebec), he describes snow-capped peaks "distant two days' journey in snow-shoes (about 60 miles)".
The journals of Lewis and Clark related a discussion on Saturday July 26th, 1806, in which the Minnetares tribe
"informed us that from hence to the establishment where they trade on the Suskasawan river is only
6 days easy march or such as they usually travel with their women and childred which may be estimated
at about 150 ms."
