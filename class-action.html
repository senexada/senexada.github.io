Subject: In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Products Liability Litigation, Case No. 1:08-WP-65000 (MDL 2001)
</pre>

<p>I thank the court for the opportunity to comment on the settlement.</p>

<p>If the Settlement's Exhibit A is accurate, that the plaintiffs have spent the last nine years of their lives reading one million pages about moldy washing machines, I pity the attorneys who would forfeit so much self respect in pursuit of filthy lucre, and I pity the judges that grant them succor for reasons unfathomable to an ordinary man.</p>

<p>You allow me to comment, but you withhold the number of defective products, the mean cost of mitigation, the probable number of claimants -- i.e. the information essential to evaluate the fairness of the settlement.</p>

<p>Attorneys I have never met are exploiting my status to obtain over $14 million for themselves.  That they fail to represent my interests is evident by the paucity of the award: an insignificant rebate on a product I had no intention of purchasing.  They offer me nothing of value, yet keep millions of dollars of cash for themselves.</p>

<p>Exhibit A states that after 9 years of legal action, the plaintiffs have not proven any claims to the satisfaction of a court of law.  To the outside observer, any further payment by Whirlpool, including legal fees or this settlement, is indistinguishable from extortion.   The court should be ashamed of itself for sanctioning extortion instead of summarily dismissing the case and assigning all legal fees to be paid by the soulless racketeers.  Nine years! Enough is enough.</p>

<p>If the court believes me to be a bona fide victim and the rebate to constitute fair and genuine compensation, I propose that the attorney fees be paid entirely in 5% rebates on Sears merchandise, with two pages of paperwork per item purchased.</p>

<p>Exclude me from the settlement.  I do not wish to partake in your extortion.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>
