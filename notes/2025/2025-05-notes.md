### Backpacking: Canadian Rockies

* GDT hiker -- 
  [Lady on a Rock][lady] -- detailed trail info, and some good packing list / gear ideas

* Tipperary Lake -- 
   [only trip report I've found][tipp] --
   >  In total, it took me about 2 hours to get to the lake from the junction.
      As a campsite, the lake was a huge disappointment. There is no flat shoreline to speak of, 
      unless it was on the opposite (north) shore. Everything on the south shore was forest filled
      with alder. I could have circled the lake on either shore, but on the west shore was another
      avalanche path and on the east was some serious cliffs that would have required gaining a
      bit of elevation before dropping back down. I had been hoping to use the lake as a base for
      exploring the alpine terrain above the lake, but there were only two routes from the lake to
      that terrain. One was an avalanche chute, and the other was a long, steep, dry creek bed
      going up a grassy slope. As I didn't want to camp at the lake, my only other option for
      exploring the alpine was to go up one of those routes to hit the alpine.

### Backpacking Gear

* KS Ultralight backpacks -- Laurent from Japan --
   [website][ksultra]

* Sawyer mini -- clogs on 2nd trip if not backflushed properly on first trip 
   [forum discussion][forum]

* Lifestraw -- requires big wide dirty water bottle, else must lie down at streams --
  [snarky nomad][snarky]
  > whenever you want a drink of water, you have to: Open the bottle,
     Open the Lifestraw‚Äôs top cap, Open the Lifestraw‚Äôs bottom cap,
     Stick the Lifestraw inside, Drink, Take it out, Expel the remaining water,
     Close the top cap, Close the bottom cap, Close the bottle.
     And then‚Ä¶you‚Äôve got a wet Lifestraw, so you‚Äôll probably end up with wet clothes.

* Hydroblu -- more popular than Sawyer on the forums --

* Backpack chlorine tabs --
   [good review][tabs] -- potable aqua cio2 and katydin micropur are best
