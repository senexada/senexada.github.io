  <span class="dropcap">A</span>fter
  last year's teenager trip, this year was the younger kids' turn for multi-night western backcountry trip.
  We arrived Denver on Thursday afternoon, shopped, and drove late through a surprisingly large cell
  phone dead zone and into the tiny town of Walden.  
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  Walden is tiny.  There was only one breakfast/sandwich shop open on Friday morning.  We were driving
  by about 8:45am and we reached the Rainbow Lake trailhead parking a half hour later, joining the
  five cars there. We packed and took our group photo:</p>

<p class="caption">Rainbow Lake Trailhead</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
  The hike to Rainbow Lake was straightforward. It follows a ridgeline through young conifers and some aspen,
  offering decent shade at a modest incline.  To the south is a flat, open park, and to the north and west
  the mountains.  
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We reached Rainbow Lake in less than two hours of walking. We lunched at the lake then scouted about 20 minutes (one way) on use trails along the north shore. Crossing the lake's outlet was trivial due to the logjam and the surefooted kids.  We chose a nice campsite in a shady spot on the north shore near the lake outlet, with plenty of daylight to swim...</p>

    ... and to collect minnows, catch minnows, and eat the minnows, which Watson later
    declared was a "terrible idea."

  <p class="regtext">
    A few raindrops threatened, then vanished. We cooked hamburgers (Patton: "second best burgers he's ever had" behind Shake Shack) and Watson ate three.  Then we sat by the fire until dark.  As usual at this elevation on day one, I struggled to sleep.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>
  
<p class="regtext">
  The breakfast tacos were super, with Patton declaring "the only time I'll eat bacon is when Jeff cooks it."
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  We began our day hike by heading due north up the ridge, planning to at minimum catch a glimpse of Ceanothuse Lake, and to go however much higher felt right.  It was reasonably steep and reasonably open, but produced some complaints when crawling over deadfall.  The complaints ceased when we found a raspberry patch, where we harvested a good bit.
</p>


<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2022/2022-Mt-Zirkel-kids/i-KMmrwd8/0/be576a54/4K/IMG_0584-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption"></p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    The travel got easier once atop the ridge, when it leveled out. There was plenty of flat land to make camp, but no real water; the one pond was stagnant and nearly dry.  We got some photos looking into Ceanothuse valley. The lake itself looked rather marshy and stagnant.

    Then, from the ridge about halfway up Rainbow lake, we traversed diagonally down the hillside, listening to Star Wars and Warriors stories while balancing down the logs:

<p class="caption">Balance on the deadfall</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    The full round trip was less than two hours, including all stops.  Back at Rainbow Lake we saw several groups of day hikers across the lake, and two overnight groups could be seen a short walk from our campsite (but not at our site itself, which was nestled above the lake in trees). We also heard some dogs later that evening, somwhere out of sight. 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The afternoon was full of swimming...

  We had two approaches: quality and quantity.  It is left as an exercise to the reader to
  decide who used which method.  A typical bombardment looked like this:

<p class="regtext"><b>Retrospective</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Scenery was good on the middle days. There was decent foot traffic on Lake Plateau, but we had solitude
  beyond Wounded Man Lake. Hiking a day in the rain
  had its upsides: fewer bugs and fewer people. Ultimately mosquitos and Vegas colluded for an early
  exit, despite the stationary site being 16 miles from the road. I guess I need to plan an
  even longer route next year.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Gear notes:</b>
<ul class="regtext">
  <li>headnet was essential</li>
  <li>bring firestarter for wet days</li>
  <li>carry more rubber bands and short lengths of cord</li>
  <li>hoodie sun shirt is big win</li>
  <li>produce bags on feet failed</li>
  <li>shoe slippers worked for one night, then had holes</li>
  <li>Sawyer Squeeze failed. Try a straw one next?</li>
  <li>Add Zyrtec to med kit</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  <b>Strategy/Logistics notes:</b>
<ul class="regtext">
  <li>Keeping heart rate < 130 was great for fatigue</li>
  <li>Crowd-pleasing to not climb a high pass on day one</li>
  <li>Remind everyone of wheat/dairy</li>
  <li>Call ranger about trail problems (rockslides, etc) that prevent stock</li>
  <li>John mentioned that poles cause +20% energy expenditure</li>
</ul>
