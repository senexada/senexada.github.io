<h2>Tech Talk -- sub $100 weekend backpacking</h2>

why:
the philsophical: John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club
In God's wildness lies the hope of the world - the great fresh unblighted, unredeemed wilderness. The galling harness of civilization drops off, and wounds heal ere we are aware.

John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir, (1938), page 317.</a>

the practical: Dan Beard, father of the american boy scouts
One reason we outdoor people love the woods is that it develops self-reliance and increases our self-respect by increasing our ability to do things; we love the work, we love the hardship, we like to get out of sight of the becapped maids, the butler and the smirking waiters waiting for a tip, and for the same reason the real honest-to-goodness American boys love a camp.

the fun: Nathan Lewis, nyc blogger
So, get a tent and go camping. What is so wonderful about a resort hotel in Palm Beach? Is it the 3-hour plane flight and shoe removal exercise? Or the $27 breakfast? Round up your buddies and drink some beer around a campfire.
