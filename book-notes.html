<h2>Book Notes</h2>
Started Jan 2017. Ordered chronologically by when I read them.

<h3>Isaac Newton by Mitch Stokes</h3>
Finished reading Dec 2016.
It is a quick, easy read, touching lightly on many aspects of his life.
It illuminates some philosophical debates at the time, especially regarding science
and physics.
<ul>
  <li>3 - born 1642, posthumously, the year that Galileo died</li>
  <li>3 - Devised gravitation "by thinking on it continually"</li>
  <li>11 - Obsessive organizer.  Arranged 2400 nouns in his notebook</li>
  <li>11 - Childhood was solitary reading and building (avid builder)</li>
  <li>21 - Cambridge founded in 1200s upon Oxford dispute. Still taught scholasticism = aristotle + Christianity</li>
  <li>21 - First 1-2 years at Cambridge he took copious notes on scholastic topics</li>
  <li>21 - Tutor Pulleyn was absent; allowed autodidact Newton to do his own thing</li>
  <li>22 - On Pentecost, age 20, listed 58 sins in his notebook</li>
  <li>27 - Copernicus made no new observations; simply offered simpler math</li>
  <li>28 - Galileo introduced quantity, measurement, and experiment into natural philosophy</li>
  <li>28 - Descartes died 1650. His philsophy had ether, vortices, and no desire or forces</li>
  <li>31 - Newton began notebook sections with a list of questions</li>
  <li>31 - Wrote <i>Amicus Plato, amicus Aristoteles, magis amica veritas</i></li>
  <li>33 - Writings on theology > chemistry/alchemy > physics</li>
  <li>34 - Taught himself trig to understand an astrology book. Began Euclid but discarded as a waste of time.</li>
  <li>36 - Masted Descartes' Geometry by restarting book whenever stuck. Sometimes progress was 2 pages per restart.</li>
  <li>41 - Plague in 1665. Moved back to Wollsthorpe for two years. Great fire 1666.</li>
  <li>44 - Boyle's <i>Christian Virtuoso</i> says experimental philosophy assists in being a good Christian</li>
  <li>47 - Developed calculus in seclusion at Woolsthorpe</li>
  <li>53 - Hooke emphasized <i>experimentum crucis</i></li>

  <li>67 - Elected to Royal Society (1672) due to handmade reflecting telescope</li>
  <li>70s - Publicity of Optics caused undesired controversy & correspondence</li>
  <li>77 - "shoulders of giants" is from private correspondence with Hooke</li>

    <i>Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John</i></li>
  <li>90 - Thought Egypt and Greece had secret wisdom from Noah, lost as they became corrupt</li>
  <li>93 - That concept found in charter of Royal Society: "attempt the recovery" of knowledge</li>
  <li>96 - Confessed reading Christian Champions as a violation of the Sabbath</li>
  <li>108 - Verified Kepler's ellipses would arise from 1/r2 force in 1679, but kept it secret</li>
  <li>108 - Philosophical point: simple mathematics was seen as proof of correctness</li>
  <li>109 - Gravity was contra Descartes's matter system, in which force reuired contact (ether).
            Jesuits decreed no action at a distance.</li>
  <li>116 - In 1684 Royal Society's big topic is path under 1/r2. Halley travels to Cambridge
            to ask Newton, who immediatly responses: ellipse; I worked it out year ago.
            Newton couldn't find the papers and rederiving it rekindled his interest in math.</li>
  <li>120 - Halley published at own expense the Principia. Third volume done in July 1687, age 44.
            Undermined Descartes with invisible action at a distance.
            Used proposition system like Euclid. Axioms were inertia, F=ma, equal & opposite force.
            Reasoned from those to universal gravitation.  Was ridiculed on the continent</li>
  <li>129 - Pythag -> Plato -> world: God ordered universe with mathematical laws</li>
  <li>131 - Byron's poem: reverse Adam's curse and steam engines will take us to the moon</li>

            of Mathematics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Will You Measure Your Life by Clayton Christensen</h3>
Finished Dec 2016.
It is a business-school-type book with principles and research for contemplating
and planning your career and family life.  The chapters stand by themselves and are
only loosley coupled.
<ul>
  <li>Chap 1 -- History & "advice" is too anecdotal; experience is too slow (do you want N marriages
      before you get good?); theory is required.  This book gives a framework, not answers. 
      The framework is built on fundamental research.  Ancillary point: convince smart people through
      allegories that they apply to themselves (Grove Intel example). </li>
  <li>Section 1 Intro -- Goal is to form a strategy to wake up every morning feeling lucky to be doing
      what you are.</li>
  <li>Chap 2 -- Incentives are popular but are only narrowly useful.  Herzberg's motivation theory
      proposes hygiene & motivation factors.  Once hygiene are good enough, you should ignore them.
      Motivation factors are the primary drivers of your personal energy & satisfaction.  Hygiene are
      comp, status, work conditions & policies; motivation are challenging work, recognition,
      responsibility, and personal growth.</li>
  <li>Chap 3 -- Initial strategy should be malleable to accomodate emergent opportunities
      (eg Honda dirtbikes).  Analyze new initiatives with a ranked list of assumptions that must
      be true for the strategy to work.</li>
  <li>Chap 4 -- Your actual strategy is where you spend your time, money, and energy.  Most people
      choose immediate gratification over long term strategy.  Analyzing your time/money/energy
      helps clarify things.</li>
  <li>Chap 5 -- Plant saplings before you need shade.  In business, seek profit first and growth
      later (eg Honda dirtbikes vs Iridium).  In personal life, family and friends will tolerate
      neglect, but time and words are long term investments that shouldn't be procrastinated.</li>
  <li>Chap 6 -- What job does it sole?  Eg Ikea, milkshakes.  Personal: apply to relationships:
      what job does my spouse need me to do?  It's a type of practical approach to empathy.</li>
  <li>Chap 7 -- In outsourcing, each step is rational, but end result is failure (eg Dell & Asus).
      Capabilities = resources (what) + processes (how) + priorities (why).  Household chores
      develop these skills in kids; outsourcing them is like Dell.  Don't outsource your role as
      parent.  (This chapter was a little long and convoluted)</li>
  <li>Chap 8 -- Choose experiences for your children that prepare them for life.  I didn't find
      anything compelling worth noting.</li>
  <li>Chap 9 -- Culture is created by doing things together, over and over.  Eg Clay only did
      housework when a kid was helping.  Important to work together and celebrate successes
      together.</li>
  <li>Chap 10 -- Marginal cost analysis is dangerous.  Eg Blockbuster, US Steel.  
      A bit of an encore on the intrasitive property of decisions: each increment may be
      prudent, but the end result is worse.  Applies marginal cost to moral realm: don't 
      take the first wrong step.  It is hard to measure the marginal cost of not doing good
      things.</li>
  <li>Epilogue -- Business needs a purpose. Your life does too.  Purpose has a
    <ul>
      <li>likeness - a sketch of what the end of the path looks like</li>
      <li>commitment - maybe even a conversion, to adapt and perservere</li>
      <li>metrics - a few measures (or just one) to keep focus</li>
    </ul>
    The how (how you get there) is typically emergent.
    The world does not deliver purposes; you must conceive, choose, manage. 
    Purpose itself can develop with time.  Clay's likeness was dedicated to improving
    lives, be kind, honest, forgiving, selfless husband/father/friend, and man who
    believes God.  His commitment was structured daily time to pray.  His metric took
    15 years to develop, and is one-on-one impacts on people's lives.  The more he focused
    on his own problems, the more despair he felt.
  </li>
</ul>
