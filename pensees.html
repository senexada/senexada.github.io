<hr/><h2 class="regtext" id="section2">Background</h2>

<p class="regtext">
Blaise Pascal's <i>Pensees</i> consists of a series of thoughts ranging from short clauses to multi-page,
well-constructed prose.  Some thoughts read like maxims, others like short essays,
yet others are inexplicable.  The Pulitzer Prize and Presidential Medal winning Durants,
in their massive 11-Volume <i>The Story of Civilization</i>, call <i>Pensees</i> 
the most eloquent book in French prose.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
<i>Pensees</i> is unusual in that the ordering of fragments affects the reading experience,
yet the fragments are ordered differently throughout the various editions.  Nor is the title even
Pascal's.  These oddities arise from its status as a work still incomplete at Pascal's
early death, at age 39, in 1662.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
For several years before his death, Pascal made notes for a book on Christian apologetics.
His notetaking method is described in Krailsheimer's Introduction to the Penguin Classic
edition (original 1966, revised 1995), which draws heavily from French-language notes by Lafuma:
</p>

<blockquote>
[Pascal] worked usually on large sheets of paper, writing down his thoughts in evident haste, with many
alterations, erasures, transpositions, sometimes setting down the words so that they looked more like
poetry than prose. Each entry was separated from the next by a line drawn between them. In about June
1658 he drew up a table of contents (the original is lost, but the surviving copy is accepted as 
authentic), with twenty-eight headings (of which one was in fact not used), corresponding to chapters
of the projected Apology, and he began to file what had so far been written.
<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>
Pascal cut [each large sheet of paper into strips] in order to file them, using a system common at
the time. He threaded a string through the corner of all the fragments allotted to a given dossier,
putting a tag at the top with the title, and tying the string to secure the <i>liasse</i> or bundle.
Each <i>liasse</i> corresponded with a heading in the table of contents already mentioned. 
</blockquote>

<p class="regtext">
Upon Pascal's death, some thoughts had been cut and collected into bundles, while the majority
had not.  Pascal left no indication of which of the unbundled fragments he would have kept, or
how they would have been integrated and ordered. That is the end, as far as Pascal himself is
concerned.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Pascal's nephew, Etienne Perier, stated that Pascal's papers were immediately
copied "as they were and in the same confusion as they had been found."  Two copies were made,
known as Copy 1 and Copy 2.  About fifty years later, the original papers (in Pascal's handwriting)
were pasted into an album, but little effort was made to preserve any sort of ordering: the fragments
were trimmed with scissors and placed wherever they would physically fit.  This album is
known as the <i>Recuiel Original</i>, Original Collection.  This original and the two Copies still exist
in the French library.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
From here a great deal of confusion arises.  The first publication, now known as the Port Royal
edition of 1670, was heavily rearranged, edited, and incomplete, probably to avoid political and
religious controvesy.  It was titled <i>Pensees de M. Pascal sur la religion et sur quelques autres sujets</i>,
and the abbreviated <i>Pensees</i> became a common title, though it was invented by the editors (not
Pascal himself).
Subsequent editions were also commonly rearranged, edited, and incomplete,
for similar reasons, or simply due to the lack of knowledge or desire to reflect an author's intent.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
Editions multiplied. Twenty three editions appeared before the year 1700. Twenty six appeared in the
1700s, and nineteen in the 1800s. In 1897, French philosopher Leon Brunschvicg published an edition
arranged topically based on his personal judgement of logical coherence.  Its numbering system became
standard in the early 20th century.

<p class="regtext">
Numbers are given as [Lafuma][Brunschvicg].  

<blockquote>
Anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself.
[36][164] 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Man, then, is so happily constituted that he has no exact principle of truth,
and several excellent ones of falsehood.
[44][82] 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
We never keep to the present. We recall the past; we anticipate the future as if 
we found it too slow in coming and were trying to hurry it up, or we recall the
past as if to stay its too rapid flight. We are so unwise that we wander about in
times that do not belongto us, and do not think of the only one that does;
so vain that we dream of times that are not and blindly flee the only one that is. The fact
is that the present usually hurts. We thrust it out of sight because it distresses us, 
and if we find it enjoyable, we are sorry to see it slip away. We try to give it the
support of the future, and think how we are going to arrange things over which
we have no control for a time we can never be sure of reaching.
[47][172]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
When I consider the brief span of my life absorbed into the eternity which comes before
and after -- as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day -- the small space
I occupy and which I see swallowed up in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I
know nothing and which know nothing of me, I take fright and am amazed to see myself 
here rather than there, now rather than then. Who put me here? By whose command and act
were this time and place allotted to me?
[68][205]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Knowledge has two extremes which meet; one is the pure natural ignorance of every man
at birth, the other is the extreme reached by great minds who run through the whole
range of human knowledge, only to find that they know nothing and come back to the same
ignorance from which they set out, but it is a wise ignorance which knows itself.
Those who stand half-way have put their natural ignorance behind them without yet
attaining the other; they have some smattering of adequate knowledge and pretend
to understand everything. They upset the world and get everything wrong.
[83][327]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Epictetus goes much further when he asks: Why do we not lose our temper if someone
tells us that we have a headache, while we do lose it if someone says there is 
anything wrong with our arguments or our choice?
<br/><br/>

The reason for that is that we are quite certain that we have not got a headache,
and are not limping, but we are not so sure we are making the right choice.
Consequently, since the only thing that makes us sure is the evidence available
to us, we hestitate and are taken aback when the evidence available to someone
else makes him see just the opposite.
[98,99][80,536]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Man's greatness comes from knowing he is wretched: a tree does not know it is wretched.
<br/><br/>
Thus it is wretched to know that one is wretched, but there is greatness in knowing one 
is wretched.
[114][397]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What then is man to do in this state of affairs? Is he to doubt everything, to doubt
whether he is awake, whether he is being pinched or burned? Is he to doubt whether he
is doubting, to doubt whether he exists?
<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>
What sort of freak then is man! How novel, how monstrous, how chaotic, how paradoxical,
how prodigious! Judge of all things, feeble earthworm, repository of truth, sink of
doubt and error, glory and refuse of the universe!
<br/><br/>
Who will unravel such a tangle? This is certainly beyond dogmatism and scepticism, beyond
all human philosophy. Let us then concede to the sceptics what they have so often
proclaimed, that truth lies beyond our scope and is an unattainable quarry, that it is no
earthly denizen, but at home in heaven, lying in the lap of God, to be known only in so far
as it pleases him to reveal it. Let us learn our true nature from the uncreated and
incarnate truth.
[131][434]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Without doubt nothing is more shocking to our reason than to say that the sin of the
first man has implicated in its guilt men so far from the original sin that they seem incapable
of sharing it.  This flow of guilt does not seem merely impossible to us, but indeed
most unjust. What could be more contrary to the rules of our miserable justice than the eternal
damnation of a child, incapable of will, for an act in which he seems to have so little
part that it was actually committed 6,000 years before he existed?  Certainly nothing jolts
us more rudely than this doctrine, and yet, but for this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all,
we remain incomprehensible to ourselves.
[131][434]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I have often said that the sole cause of man's unhappiness is that he does not know how to
stay quietly in his room.
<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>
All our life passes in this way: we seek rest by struggling against certain obstacles, and
once they are overcome, rest proves intolerable because of the boredom it produces.
<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>
This is why this man, who lost his only son a few months ago and was so troubled and oppressed
this morning by lawsuits and quarrels, is not thinking about it any more. Do not be surprised;
he is concentrating all his attention on which way the boar will go that his dogs have been so
hotly pursuing for the past six hours. That is all he needs. However sad a man may be, if you
can persuade him to take up some diversion he will be happy while it lasts.
[136][139]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man 
a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries
in vain to fill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot
find in those that are, though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only
with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself.
[148][428]
