Similarly flawed are NOAA’s claims that increasing annual counts of billion dollar disasters are in part a consequence of human caused climate change. NOAA’s claims to have achieved detection and attribution are not supported by any scientific analysis that it has performed. " -

    "The humanistic way of thinking, which had proclaimed itself our guide, did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man, nor did it see any task higher than the attainment of happiness on earth. It started modern Western civilization on the dangerous trend of worshiping man and his material needs. Everything beyond physical well-being and the accumulation of material goods, all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature, were left outside the area of attention of state and social systems, as if human life did not have any higher meaning. Thus gaps were left open for evil, and its drafts blow freely today. Mere freedom per se does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and even adds a number of new ones."

Crichton: "But don't you find it boring to wear only two colors?"<br/>
"Not at all. I find it liberating. I believe my life has value, and I don't want to
waste it thinkinga bout clothing," Malcolm said. "I don't want to think about what I
will wear in the morning. Truly, can you imagine anything more boring than fashion?
Professional sports, perhaps. Grown men swatting little balls, while the rest of the
world pays money to applaud.  But, on the whole, I find fasion even more tedious
than sports."
