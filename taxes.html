<h2>Tax Year 2015</h2>
I learned that:

<h4>Partnerships have tax complications, including super-tax rates</h4>

<p>The downsides:
<ul>
  <li>K-1 Timing -- often arrive after April 15. This year I got a corrected K1 in October</li>
  <li>Mgmt Fee -- is not deductible, so creates a super-tax rate</li>
  <li>State taxes -- can create non-resident tax liability in many states</li>
</ul>

<p>Super-tax example: a net return of 10%, based on a 12% return of
operating income and a 2% management fee.  The income is taxed at 50.5% (see calculations in 2014),
so the tax is $6.06 for every $10 in net return.  If the 12% is a capital
gain, taxed at 33%, the tax is $3.96 for every $10 in net return: nearly 40%. </p>


<p>In fairness, some advantages of partnerships include privacy, majority control,
no double taxation, different opportunities than public markets (smaller companies, etc), and access
to non-recourse leverage (a dubious advantage; I should write a leverage analysis).
</p>

<h4>Mark-to-Market Assets Are Doubly Bad</h4>
Consider an asset that gains 30% over 3 years, but with volatility. As an example,
<pre>
  Year 1 =  +20%
  Year 2 =  +20%
  Year 3 =  -10%
</pre>

<p>Assume you are in a high bracket in a high-tax locale like nyc.  You invest $1000 in asset A,
which has mark-to-market 60/40 LT/ST treatment, or asset B, which does not. </p>

<p>In a simple case, you sell the asset at the end of year 3 while still in your high tax locale.
We are using 50.5% and 33% for ST and LT rates (see 2014 notes below).
<pre>
  Asset A
  Year     LT Gain  LT Tax  ST Gain  ST Tax
  ====     =======  ======  =======  ======
   1       200*0.6    40    200*0.4    40
   2       240*0.6    48    240*0.4    48
   3       -144*0.6  -29   -144*0.4   -29

   TOTAL              59              59   = 118 tax
</pre>

<pre>
  Asset B
  Year     LT Gain  LT Tax  ST Gain  ST Tax
  ====     =======  ======  =======  ======
   1          0       0        0        0
   2          0       0        0        0
   3         300     100       0        0

   TOTAL             100                   = 100 tax
</pre>
</p>

<p>On its face, the tax difference is small: $18 on the $300 gain, or 6%.
But the situation can deteriorate in many ways.  If you can hold asset B until
in a low income year and locale, or if you donate B, you could reduce B's tax as far as $0.
In that case, the tax rate difference is 39% vs. 0%.
</p>

<p>An additional hit can arise if you have other LT gains.  In the case that A's year 3 ST losses
offset LT gains, the tax benefit of -29 is reduced to -19.  Thus A's effective tax rate becomes
43%, verses B's effective rate of 0-33%.
</p>


<h2>Tax Year 2014</h2>
I learned that:

<h4>Lending Club income can be taxed at 70% or more</h4>
Impossible, you say?
<p>Say your account grew in value by $1000.
One possible breakdown (similar to my actual breakdown one year) is +2000 interest income and -1000 loan chargeoffs.
</p>
<p>
The +2000 is fully taxed at your max rate, which in nyc can be as high as  39.6 + 3.8 + 8.97 + 3.5 = 55.87%
(it's actually a bit less because the feds don't tax you on your state tax. So, it's more like 50.5%)
The -1000 is a capital loss, which offsets long term cap gains at 20 + 3.8 + 8.97 + 3.5 = 36.27% (actually 33%, for the same reasons above).
</p>

<pre>
   Tax on income = 2000 * 0.505 = 1010
   Tax reduction from capital loss = 1000 * 0.33 = 330
   Net taxes from Lending Club = 670
</pre>

<p>Your net income was 1000 and you paid 670 in extra taxes --> 67% tax rate.
It can be worse if you already have net capital losses, in which case the capital loss benefit
cannot be used until a future year.  Depending on the time until used, your choice of
discount rate, and your locale/income when used, the capital loss "benefit" could be worth as
little as zero (if your income is low enough to be in the 0% federal capital gains bracket and you
live in a no-income-tax state).  In that worst case -- admittedly, an extreme scenario --
 the Lending Club income was taxed at over 100% !
