  <span class="dropcap">A</span>fter
  last year's teenager trip, this year was the younger kids' turn for multi-night western backcountry trip.
  We arrived Denver on Thursday afternoon, shopped, and drove in darkness through a surprisingly large cell
  phone dead zone into the town of Walden.  
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  Walden is tiny.  There was only one breakfast/sandwich shop open on Friday morning.  We were driving
  by about 8:45am and we reached the Rainbow Lake trailhead a half hour later, joining the
  five cars there. We packed and took our group photo:</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2022/2022-Mt-Zirkel-kids/i-GQ5j7LT/0/ed6759a6/4K/IMG_0538-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">Rainbow Lake Trailhead</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
  The hike to Rainbow Lake was straightforward. It follows a ridgeline through young conifers and some aspen,
  offering decent shade at a modest incline.  To the south is a flat, open park, and to the north and west
  the mountains.  
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We reached Rainbow Lake in less than two hours of walking. We lunched at the lake then scouted about 20 minutes (one way) on use trails along the north shore. Crossing the lake's outlet was trivial due to the logjam and the surefooted kids.  We chose a nice campsite in a shady spot on the north shore near the lake outlet, with plenty of daylight to swim...</p>

    ... and to catch minnows, and eat the minnows, which Watson later
    declared was a "terrible idea."
</p>

<p class="caption">Catching our first dinner using mosquito headnets</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    A few raindrops threatened, then vanished. We cooked hamburgers (Patton: "second best burgers he's ever had" behind Shake Shack) and Watson ate three.  Then we sat by the fire until dark.  As usual at this elevation on day one, I struggled to sleep.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>
  
<p class="regtext">
  The breakfast tacos were super, with Patton declaring "the only time I'll eat bacon is when Jeff cooks it."
</p>

<p class="regtext">
  We began our day hike by heading due north up the ridge, planning to catch a glimpse of Ceanothuse Lake, and to go however much higher felt right.  It was manageably steep and reasonably open, but produced some complaints when crawling over deadfall.  The complaints ceased when we found a raspberry patch, where we harvested a good bit.
</p>


<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2022/2022-Mt-Zirkel-kids/i-KMmrwd8/0/be576a54/4K/IMG_0584-4K.jpg">

<p class="caption">Wild berry harvest</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    The travel got easier along the ridgeline. There was plenty of flat land if one wanted to make camp, but no real water; the one pond was stagnant and nearly dry.  We got some photos looking into Ceanothuse valley. The lake itself looked rather marshy and stagnant.
</p>

<div class="photo"><a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/2022/2022-Mt-Zirkel-kids/i-jntcNkq/0/10946c7e/X5/IMG_0587-X5.jpg">

<p class="caption"></p>Ceanothuse valley from the ridge</div>

  <p class="regtext">
    Then, from the ridge about halfway up Rainbow lake, we traversed diagonally down the hillside, listening to Star Wars and Warriors stories while balancing down the logs:

<p class="caption">Fast footwork down the deadfall</p></div>

  <p class="regtext">
    The full round trip was less than two hours, including all stops.  Back at Rainbow Lake we saw several groups of day hikers across the lake, and two overnight groups could be seen a short walk from our campsite (but not visible from our site, which was nestled above the lake in trees). We also heard some dogs later that evening, somewhere out of sight. 
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The afternoon was full of swimming...

  We had two approaches: quality and quantity.  It is left as an exercise to the reader to
  decide who used which method.  A typical bombardment looked like this:

<p class="regtext">
Later in the evening, Patton saw an inchworm and yelled at it: "start measuring!"  There were also some highly amusing talks about making $50/hour selling ramen, and how to "shop like a Karen" (not my phrase). </p>

<p class="regtext">
And then there was my personal favorite activity, the third "wild foods" element of the trip (minnows and raspberries being one and two): the eating of the grasshoppers.  The kids had collected them and made a pointy stick.  They roasted them and took the dare:

<p class="regtext">
  Dinner was Kraft Mac'n'cheese, which was the favorite despite forgetting butter. The 365 brand got no love.  The night's fireside discussion covered food ideas for future trips.  Watson wants to bring beans and butter.  All the kids were excited about a future ramen meal.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Three</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
The morning was quiet and dry: no dew anywhere to be seen.  Maybe that's why I saw two mosquitos the entire trip and got zero bites.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
We cooked Pancakes for two hours.  Watson ate two adult's worth.  Then we did some leisurely packing, and started downhill about 11am.

<p class="regtext"><b>Retrospective</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  <ul class="regtext">
    <li>Rainbow Lake was a beautiful spot</li>
    <li>Starting a day before the holiday weekend allowed us to beat the crowds and secure a good campsite.</li>
    <li>Foam pad was great for daytime napping without concern for sharp rocks</li>
    <li>Add fish line and hook to emergency kit</li>
    <li>Kids could have hiked farther, but this distance (3-4 mi) allowed a
      good mix of foot travel and leisure</li>
    <li>Hannah's trail mix recipe was good: 4oz cashew, 4oz almond, 4oz peanut,
      5oz raisin, 5oz M+M</li>
    </ul>
