 <li> MRI showing more rumination activity after urban walk vs. rural -- published in National Academy of Science -- <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/28/8567.abstract">Full paper (free)</a> -- <a href="http://www.futurity.org/nature-depression-951762/">A news summary</a> -- <br/> From abstract: <i>a 90-min walk in a natural setting, decreases both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC), whereas a 90-min walk in an urban setting has no such effects on self-reported rumination or neural activity. In other studies, the sgPFC has been associated with a self-focused behavioral withdrawal linked to rumination in both depressed and healthy individuals.</i>

 <li> Blood pressure, anger, and attention span better after rural vs. urban walk -- J of Environmental Psychology -- <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494402001093">Abstract (full article is paywall)</a> -- From abstract: <i>Subsequently walking in a nature reserve initially fostered blood pressure change that indicated greater stress reduction than afforded by walking in the urban surroundings. Performance on an attentional test improved slightly from the pretest to the midpoint of the walk in the nature reserve, while it declined in the urban setting. This opened a performance gap that persisted after the walk. Positive affect increased and anger decreased in the nature reserve by the end of the walk; the opposite pattern emerged in the urban environment. </i>
