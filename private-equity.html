Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Cannot meaningfully measure performance for many years</li>
<li>Capital calls at arbitrary times require liquidity and frequent email access</li>
<li>Capital is called over many years, which aggravates the intermediate liquidity & investment situation</li>
<li>Typically less than committed capital is called, but no guarantee</li>
<li>Performance fee is based on IRR, which somewhat misaligns mgmt & investors
  (ex: sell after 6 months at +30% or after 12 months at +50%. Mgmt will sell after 6)</li>
<li>K1 tax complications -- late, state-source income, complex credit/recapture rules</li>
<li>You lose all timing over taxable income and type</li>
<li>The 2% mgmt fee is not tax deductable, but gains are fully taxed, which creates a super-tax regime</li>
<li>The private equity space is very competitve, increasing the risk of overpaying or adverse selection</li>
<li>The fund's success depends a lot on the team, but the team can be fragile due to back loaded comp
  (good people may leave early, which is highly disruptive, if they anticipate a small performance fee)</li>
