<blockquote>
  <p>But what kind of information are you trying to learn from a fiction book?
The book is literally labelled FALSE on the cover. I can hear the outraged
answer from the literati already. It will be something like “I read to
understand the human condition by engaging deeply with a wide breadth of
human experience and perspectives.” Good. I agree. And since this is the
same basic answer as to why you should read history, philosophy, etc as well
(books that are deceptively labelled NOT FALSE on the cover), I think it’s fair
to lump all these subjects together.</p>

<p>But if this answer is correct, it leads us to a troubling conclusion: New
books are not worth reading. Why? Because everyone alive today has the same
perspective, and none of us have experienced a wide breadth of anything.
Especially not those of us who are likely to get platformed by a major publisher.</p>

<li><p>Old UR post about slow history (compare with New Books Aren't Worth Reading) --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why not grapple with some slow history? Slow history, which is a lot 
like slow food but cheaper, is no more than the habit of reading old books, 
whole and unframed. By “old” we generally mean pre-WWII, or better yet pre-1923 
(the copyright cutoff date). By “unframed” we mean: take the work seriously, 
without “deconstructing” or patronizing.</p>

<p>You think of a hamburger as something you get at McDonald’s. Your Big Mac is 
made of actual beef, no doubt, from actual cows. There is nothing really wrong 
with it, besides the fact that it’s been industrially processed into culinary oblivion.</p>

<p>Chez Panisse will also serve you a hamburger. The difference between fast 
history and slow history is the difference between a Big Mac, and a grass-fed 
Niman Ranch with a hand-cut square of aged raw-milk white cheddar. The former 
is certainly more efficient. You can learn all the beefy and factual facts you 
care to absorb from textbooks, Wikipedia, and even academic sources. Fast history, 
like McDonald’s, is a magnificent production. All we’re saying is that McDonald’s 
is not, and will never be, Chez Panisse.</p>

<li><p>Twitter thread on neurotypical communication --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday I learned how neurotypical communication works and its 
about the most upsetting thing I've ever learned</p>

<p>Its like reading Body Ritual among the Nacirema because this is 
literally just how neurotypicals act because literally all their 
communication- verbal and nonverbal- is about status (which includes 
never being allowed to admit that is the case)</p>

<p>And moreover it explains why I come off as so strange to them- 
because I didnt even know status was a thing at all until very 
recently (and even then I thought it was a joke and no one could 
actually care about such a thing), I've been wildly signaling 
high and low status, which confounds them. Its like speaking 
in all vowels to speakers of an abjad language. There's just 
this entire dimension of communication I don't control for because
it seems deeply immoral to me- but its the ENTIRE BASIS of their communication</p>

<p>You cant say [neutral, observably true fact about yourself (high 
status)] and [neutral, observably true fact about yourself (low status)] 
even though theyre both neutral and observably true. It breaks their 
brains. They dont understand what youre "getting at", because all of 
their communication is about status, so theyre trying to figure out which one is the lie</p>

<p>This is also why theyll lie to your face and say things like "you're not fat"
 if they like you. To them, they're saying a nice thing because fat=bad 
and you≠bad, unaware theyre 1. lying to you, which isnt nice and 2. 
implicitly admitting that they think the thing that you observably and neutrally ARE is bad</p>

<p>Which leads to the ultimate unfortunate paradox- the options are to 
lie all the time like NTs but be seen as telling the truth, or to 
keep telling the truth but be seen as a liar</p>

<p>Its such a dark test of whether honesty and morality genuine matter
to you as a person- is it more important to BE honest and moral or BE SEEN as honest and moral</p>

<p>And the most confounding thing is if status is the only thing that 
matters to them, and truth is unimportant to them, why dont they 
all just choose to constantly signal high status and break the game 
altogether? This seems to be how sociopaths and narcissists work and 
why NTs give them all their power. If they insist on maximizing for 
status- even at the expense of truth and morality- why dont they actually just do it?</p>

<p>The whole thing is so bizarre</p>

<p>I think ultimately the most mind boggling thing is to realize that I was 
playing on an x,y (truth, morality) coordinate system, while most of the 
other people around me were playing to maximize the z axis (status) 
which I didnt even know existed and for them x and y were only useful 
insofar as they were instrumental for increasing z</p>

<p>No wonder I appear strange to them! My z is all over the place! And no 
wonder they seem stupid and evil so often because they only use x and y when its in service of z!</p>

<p>Curiouser and curiouser!</p>

  <p>The only way to access the trailhead is to contract with an Indian guide to have them drive
 you to and from the trailhead. Contact Ramona O'Neal (Mone) at 307-486-2318 for
 transportation. She lives right next door to the Crowheart Store / gas station. The driveway
to her home is 20 feet north of the store.</p>

<p>The standard meeting time is 8am at Mone's house, and 11am at the Cold Springs trailhead
for the return ride. The ride to/from the trailhead is about 1.5 hours over a rough 4WD dirt
 road. You leave your car at Mone's house. Cost for the transportation seems to vary,
 depending perhaps on whether or not there are any other pick-ups / drop-offs combined with
 yours. When I first called Mone, she quoted a cost of $600 round trip for 2 people. When I
called back to reserve a date and told her there were 3 of us, the price was still $600 total.
Then when I arrived and there were only 2 of us, the price dropped to $500. (I didn't question
the discount.) </p>

<li><strong>whatifalist</strong> on socialism -- <a href="https://nitter.net/whatifalthist/status/1990524157419728911#m">nitter post</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the horrifying things I realized was Socialism was basically voting public’s begging to
have serfdom again. This was something that was widely said during the early USSR, which
was called “the second serfdom” by Russian peasants. In both there’s no private property,
everything is collective and under total ownership by a repressive state. Russia was unusually
bad as serfdom went, with High Medieval Western Europe being way better than either.</p>

<p>What the Socialist says when he wants no struggle, no property, no competition and no choice
is “I crave a life of slavery that doesn’t require I think or take responsibility for my choices at all”.
That’s why Communism always devolves into the state forcing you to work with terrible
conditions, which is de facto identical to slavery. The fact he's not mature  enough to realize
he's doing this should more than prove my point.</p>

<p>The feudal lord is way nicer by and large than the Socialist state. My historic speciality is the
Middle Ages. You don’t want to fight me on this. The feudal lord gets to be rich and powerful
while the Socialist state is impersonal. That’s the core of it. They would rather live in slavery
than live better and know someone else is better than them</li>
