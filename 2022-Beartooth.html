  <span class="dropcap">T</span>wice in this series we have exited the
  backcountry early: once for wildfire smoke, once for a confluence
  of heavy winds and route challenge.  This year was our third early exit,
  for a new reason to be revealed to the perservering reader. As usual,
  you may click images for a high-res version.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day One</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  Bozeman was our launch point into the 944,000-acre Absaroka Beartooth
  Wilderness, which lies along the north border of Yellowstone. 
  We departed the downtown Kimpton (brand new) on Saturday morning Aug 6
  after a superb avacado toast on site.  Driving by 7:40am, we took I-90
  east to Livingston, exited onto Swingley Rd, and lost cell service by
  08:25.  We hit the National Forest boundary at 09:00, heading into the
  valley amid an unsettled forecast and clouds that threatened rain.
</p>

<p class="caption">Southbound on Boulder Creek Rd, with rain threatening</p></div>

<p class="regtext">
  Road quality was excellent, and had been repaired from a major washout,
  presumably due to the many large permanent camps along this stretch.
  The road degraded only for the last handful of miles, during which we 
  averaged 8-10 mph, reaching Upsidedown Trailhead (our exit point) at 09:58 and
  Box Canyon Trailhead (our starting point) at 10:10.  A few spots felt
  sketchy in our SUVs, so we were humbled to see six horse trailers and a Corolla
  were among the ten vehicles at the trailhead. 
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    It was about 50F and verging on rain as we packed.
    We got the group shot at a fine bridge right at the parking lot.
</p>

    The trail up East Fork Boulder Creek begins wide and gentle, quickly entering the tall pines.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    A light-to-steady rain  began about noon and continued all day and night, so the photo
    above is all you get today.  The handful of unforested sections had nothing to see due to
    the rain and mist. But the trail was gentle, the creeks were
    all well-bridged, and the forest was glistening, so it was a pleasant hike nonetheless.
</p>

<p class="caption">Ok, I lied, I found one more unspectactular photo before the rain</p></div>
  
<p class="regtext">
  We couldn't see much in the mist, but we passed a few erratic boulder fields interrupting the forest,
  and saw the small lake after the Rainbow Creek junction, which was pretty and had a campsite.
</p>

<p class="regtext">  
    We continued up Rainbow Creek to a decent campsite (or so it seemed in the mist) at about 8800'.
    We managed with great effort to burn the drenched wood in a meager fire, just enough to
    cook the steaks.  Despite several heavy bouts of rain, which soaked every sock I
    was carrying,
    everyone was satisfied with the day: good trail, good distance, good elevation, and
    reasonable temperatures.  There wasn't much lounging after dinner, as the rain continued
    most of the night.

<p class="regtext"><b>Day Two</b></p>

<p class="regtext">
  At 8:30 the glorious sun reached our camp.  I spent a couple hours drying my entire wardrobe,
  and others did similarly. We broke camp at 11am and by noon I felt hot and dry, a short six
  hours after feeling that everything I owned would be damp the entire trip.  We declared
  a "0%" chance of rain for the rest of the trip.

  <p class="regtext">
    We passed a handful of groups today after seeing only two people in yesterday's rain.
    Ascending toward Lake Plateau, we encountered the first meaningful meadows and open vistas.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    At Wounded Man Lake we passed two fisherman. Continuing along its north shore on
    trail 93, there was deadfall across the trail and accordingly no sign of recent
    stock usage.  We took a break at the foot of Lake Pinchot before moving onward toward
    our target of Ravin (or maybe Cimmerian) Lake.
</p>

<p class="caption">North shore of Woulded Man or Pinchot (not sure which) from Trail 91</p></div>
  
  <p class="regtext">
    The trail after Pinchot becomes narrow & overgrown as it steeply descends the
    forested ravine. Dreary Lake is aptly named and had no decent campsites, due to sloped forest or
    marshy ground everywhere we scouted.  We lost the trail as it braided through a few small
    meadows, before finding a bridge across the stream entering Ravin. Ravin was beautiful, but
    we scouted all the way to
    Ravin foot without finding a large enough campsite, then surrendered before reaching
    Lake Surrender and worked back toward Pinchot.  There was a decent site north of the trail
    on the west end of Ravin, but the views weren't as good as the foot of Pinchot, so we
    continued to retrace our steps upstream.
</p>

  <p class="regtext">
    Around 5:30 we reached the beautiful meadow at the foot of Lake Pinchot, having traveled
    9.5 miles today (27k steps according to my watch).

  <p class="regtext">
    We ate Ramen and S'mores and began to battle the mosquitos, which will figure prominently
    over the next two days.  The headnets were well worth their 1oz weight.  Any exposed
    skin, or even single layer, was attacked.  As it cooled enough to don multi-layer mosquito
    protection we watched twilight over the lake.

<p class="regtext">
Mileage and elevations were good. The last two days were most scenic. It was good to do the
Tin Cup Trail downhill rather than uphill.
</p>

<p class="regtext">
The unnamed peak (mentioned in the Teton NP episode) looks to be a unique, spectacular spot to
view and photograph Grand Teton.  It may be worth a return trip, hiking out Mink Lake through
the National Park.  The Teton Crest route also looks appealing.  Some related Teton Crest links:
